GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation
_____________________________________________________

We set hyperparameters in demo.sh, eg, VECTOR_SIZE=100, for mentioning vector dimension, MAX_ITER=2000, for 2000 epochs
demo.sh file is called from train-model.sh
text8 consists of all email data concatenated, present in google drive

./training-job.sh 1 100 2000
for now set vector size and number of epochs in demo.sh
