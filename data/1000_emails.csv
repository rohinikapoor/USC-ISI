57,foothi19@idt.net,charlotte@wptf.org,"THE FRIDAY BURRITO"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."There is a hint of Autumn in the air.  I don=0F t know if it=0F s wishfulthinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our palesummer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=0F s premature, I know.  A fewfallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows... I=0F m jumping the gun.  I can=0F t wait for this summer to be over,especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the dinof the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, Ican barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up: fires inMontana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipelinein New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions forcommercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting importsof Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buyingabout 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position. I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes theCalifornia restructured power industry.  I just want to end to thesummer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even inCleveland.There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect ofthe wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=0F srequest.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State AttorneysGeneral has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-stategenerators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=0F t havean ongoing study of the California Market, then you=0F re not hip.All of these investigations, save FERC=0F s Section 206 Investigation, aregoing to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  ThePUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Nowthey need some evidence to support their assertions.And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talkto many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, andanyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You wantto show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market ismaking things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, aredamnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of thosepeople for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against priceshocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.The public isn=0F t going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.And let=0F s face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, ourindustry is not known for turning in A+ performances, except for SCE.Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at everyturn.  I heard SCE is putting on their customers=0F  bill, =0F"Here is whatyou would have paid if the rate freeze ended ....=0F".  But many of us inthe new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gasindustry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the bestresponse to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of anangry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shallpass.I don=0F t buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=0F tbelieve we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  Whatelectric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,and in everyone=0F s best interests.  Look at it this way, when they patthe last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do youmost want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will ofothers, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was rightinstead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit lacedwith sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture andnot just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So joinme and stand up for what you believe.  They can=0F t take away your pride,not yet.Here is this week=0F s line up.>>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F s Order on SDG&E Complaint @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy Product>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A Response>>> Odds and Ends (_!_) @@@ Finish the Story Contest @@@ October General Meeting @@@ What Makes Houston, Houston?>>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F s Order on SDG&E ComplaintPresident Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in SanDiego, retired, fixed-income, likely to vote for a Democrat, are makingchoices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes.  I callthis the Del Monica Beach lecture.  The Prez instructed the FERC toinvestigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.In response to SDG&E=0F s August 2 complaint, whereby the utility askedFERC to impose a $250 price cap on generators in the region, the FERCresponded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago.  TheFERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERCalso initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale powermarket in California.Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERC=0F s Order:=0F"In this order, ... , we are denying SDG&E s requested immediateimposition of a price cap on all sellers in California.  However, we areinstituting consolidated hearing   proceedings pursuant to section 206of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonablenessof the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy andancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX, and to alsoinvestigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylawsof the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficientoperation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in Californiaand need to be modified=0F"SDG&E concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive ifsellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels thatwould prevail in open competition, i.e., sellers are able to bid andreceive prices significantly above their marginal costs.  SDG&E alsoargues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices andthe erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication thatthe market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.=0F"While we find it appropriate to institute a section 206 hearing onthese issues, we cannot implement an immediate price cap of $250/MWh asrequested by SDG&E because there is no record before us to support suchan action.  ...  While the issues raised by this complaint areimportant, the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDG&E s proposalto place an immediate, arbitrary $250/MWh cap on the price that everypublic utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into thePX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard.  SDG&E has provided noevidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercisemarket power, has not documented a single instance of a sellerexercising market power during times of scarcity, and did not attempt toshow that the conditions underlying the Commission s approval ofmarket-based rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillaryservices have changed.  Nor did it address specific market orinstitutional  factors that may be causing rates to be unjust orunreasonable.=0F"SDG&E asserts that the ISO s congestion management and marketstructures are flawed and in need of overhaul. ... Furthermore, SDG&Eexpresses its concern that, for a number of reasons, the congestionmanagement and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholderswill not produce  meaningful results.  SDG&E indicates that it isprepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals;however, SDG&E s complains that the ISO stakeholder process has, inSDG&E s judgment, been ineffective with respect to these issues.=0F"Various interveners contend that SDG&E s arguments are premature. ...We agree with Interveners. ...  The reform efforts have been the subjectof extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.Accordingly, we reject SDG&E s arguments at this time.=0F"It is unclear whether SDG&E s failure to purchase hedging instrumentsfor its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or itsbusiness decisions.  A retail rate design that exposes consumers to thevolatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly whenconsumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to pricesignals.=0F"We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in thereal-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns....  Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resourcesneeded for the operating day.  Not only does this procurement practiceput pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the lastminute, but the practice is uneconomical.  Such spot-market purchasesare not subject to the ISO s  buyer s cap.  Furthermore, because the ISOis the supplier of last resort for these services, when OOM calls aremade, suppliers realize that the ISO is in a must-buy situation.=0F"In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediatelyinstitute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessaryto reliably operate the grid.  Specifically, the ISO should anticipatethe need for such additional resources based on  forecasted peakperiods.  We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis ofthe need for and level of purchase price caps and to include thisanalysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase pricecap authority.=0F"In closing, WPTF is an intervenor in the case, and we hope to be veryactive in the case through testimony, cross examination, the filing ofbriefs, and reply briefs.>>> Things in the People=0F s Republic of California @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy ProductSeveral weeks ago, I discussed with the ISO their interest in developinga new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in themorning of a trade day, and be dispatched during the super-peak hours.I challenged them to let the market participants develop this marketinstead of the ISO doing the same.At the August 1 ISO Governing Board meeting, I stated as the WPTFposition that we oppose price caps, but if the ISO Governing Boardinsisted on going down the $250/MWH price cap route, we would do whatever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage 3alerts.  Whereas I didn=0F t think about the conversation on super-peakblock markets as being relevant to  the remarks before the GoverningBoard, it became painfully clear soon after that we could, and shouldwork with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or theCalifornia PX, or both, to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Outof Market system.This week, WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sidesdiscussed the merits of a super-peak block firm-energy product, and howit could be instituted.  The meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had manyof its members who either have generation in the State, or import powerinto California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss howto bring more order and price transparency to the ISO s out of marketcalls. The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of moneyspent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.  Last year thetotal cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them,presented their proposals at the meeting.  The discussions which ensuedduring the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO mightutilize a product/service to reduce the manpower requirements currentlyneeded to satisfy its out of market telephone calls, typically on shortnotice, and the interest on the part of market participants to make bidsinto either the APX or CalPX s proposed system for a super-peakfirm-energy product.There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness towork together to alleviate the problems associated with findingsufficient electric power during high demand periods with greatertransparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.We=0F ll keep you posted on our development of this market.>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A ResponseSometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as Idid last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the storycalled the Trial of Gow Jing.  Mike sent me a note that I would like toshare. He said I could.  I want you to read it and appreciate that thereare other people who share his view.  I also copied the response I sentto Michael, a.k.a. Old Deuteronomy.Michael wrote:=0F"I m not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama [theGow-Jing story], but I did want to offer an observation.  In simplertimes, people knew the other people that they did business with, andthey typically lived in the same community.  If a merchant tried tocharge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only onein town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of hisfellow citizens.  This undoubtedly served as a constraint on suchbehavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC. Telling Mrs. Jones thatthe loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would notbe a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did nothappen.=0F"In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doingbusiness has been almost completely lost.  And so has the restraint.  Ihave no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez,I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the endresults of their business decisions are invisible.  If Mrs. Jones can tafford to run her refrigerator any more, that fact is at best dimlyperceived, and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of socialprogram, not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior.=0F"This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because bothscenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.  Butcertainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better inmy view.  Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out ofevery transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one isresponsible for the end result.  Is this the kind of world we want tolive in???=0F"PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!  YOU CAN EVENBLAME ME, SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLEAGE.      Deut=0F"Okay.  It=0F s in the Burrito.  And here is what I think.You allude to the change in a world that was once =0F"more personal=0F" and= isnow institutional.  You make the point that things are not better off iffor no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.  But Idon=0F t think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.  It isever present, as I will argue below.  Second, your group embraces theimpersonal =0F"efficiencies=0F" when it is convenient.  Finally and mostimportantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterpartsbe when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which mighthappen in a handful of years?However, your essential point is not lost on me.  I do believe thatthere are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors inCalifornia.  I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear yourresponse.First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.  Iexercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of myconsulting engagements which require financial give and take betweenclient and vendor.  It is simply smart business to do so.  I have beenthe beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred inmy checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedlylate, etc., and the late fee forgiven.  However, much of our economy,and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires theuse of markets.  Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all theefficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharingof price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor theinitial producer.  The producer and consumer get out of the riskarbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it hasdone on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation inthe ISO=0F s congestion management reform.  Elimination of marketseparation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties toexecute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in thename of market efficiency.  Lower prices for consumers.  Does it reallymatter if it is done through person to person transactions, or throughmarkets?Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.  Whathappens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next towndown the road?  All the faithful customers that your Merchant ofVengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greaterinventory, more choice, and lower prices.  What do you say, then?  Thecorollary for us is direct.  The new generation owners moved literallybillions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.  Itpaid off.  They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably willnext year, and so on.  But the 3,000 MW of new power plants underconstruction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction inArizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects inCalifornia, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permitswill change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized.  Theprices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want toknow, where will today=0F s accusers be when there is a shake out?Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But thealliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.You gotta make hay while the sun shines.Now to my proposal.   Michael, I would be willing to work with you todevelop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercialcustomers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higherelectricity prices.  I could imagine, although I haven=0F t tested the ideawith any parties,  that a significant program could be crafted, possiblysecured by the credit of participating generating companies, andexecuted by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America.Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.It=0F s simply smart business, not charity.  It=0F s one way to amortize th=eearnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relativeto the sudden growth of demand for power.Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=0F t know. One couldargue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level paymentplan for it=0F s consumers.  True, it is no different, because in eithercase the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrativefees, and I consistently believe that a market for credit is moreefficient (am I getting impersonal?) than one instituted by amonopoly.   Second, the security for these loans is provided by partiesother than the utility=0F s customers.  Further, we wouldn=0F t have to wor=ryabout PUC oversight and prudence reviews.  We could make this workquickly.I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of mymembers.  Thanks for sending us your letter.>>> Odds and Ends (_!_) @@@ Finish the Story ContestWell, there was only one response, and that was from Carl Imparato.Here is what Carl said,=0F"Am I missing something?

896,e..rosenberg@enron.com,"eric.gadd@enron.com,kevin.hyatt@enron.com","Met with Mike Smith and Arnold Eisenstein this AM.  One problem I see is that the mileages and the capital in the presentation don t match.  The $822 mm seems to match a case with 175 miles of mainline rather than 239.Arnold and Ron Matthews had already tentatively scheduled a get-together tomorrow to work on optimization and to get the facilities and the estimates on the same page.Mike Smith mentioned that looks like the Indian ROW renewal will cost about $80mm in todays dollars, $40mm in ten years, remainder in 20.  Not sure what a reasonable escalator is to use for reservations.Regarding Bush  tarriff.  I would not assume that there is enuf contingency and escalation to cover the increase.  The escalation is there to cover normal inflation of material and construction costs and the contingency is there to cover the incompleteness in scoping at the time of the estimate preparation.  (Rand Corp some years back did an extensive study of estimates ex contingency versus final costs and confirmed that primarily due to insufficient scoping details, a seemingly large level of contingency was required to cover the actual costs.   When a project is a gleam in someone s eye, probably need 25%, by the time you are starting construction - maybe 5%.)Also James C. sent me a copy of his baseline model.  I have a relatively quick and dirty model I use for preliminary analyses and for roughly the same assumptions we ended up in about the same place - about 5.5% IRR on equity. Bear in mind that this included no increases in volumes over time, no incremental Row payments and no payoff at the end of 20 years.  Another point.  Will you really be able to sell the 540 at 45 cents (plus a bush tarriff kicker) 100% 365 days a year?That s all for now.  Have a surprise 1 o clock with Horton."

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers  needs.Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT ***These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron s preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National s and Alamo s preferred traveler programs.  National s Emerald Club membership and Alamo s Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.

These agreements have been approved by local counsel in Japan.  This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.  As is the case for all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC s governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the counterparty is situated.  When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that bridge is still ahead of us.I don t know what the "international contracts" are that Rousseau refers to.  There is no standard agreement for online trading.  The ETA provides that if a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place (such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions.  The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the time the master was signed.In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, the legal side of things is ready to go.MarkAlan Aronowitz04/03/2000 11:52 AMTo: Joseph P Hirl/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rousseau Anai/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Japan  I have copied Mark Taylor on this note and asked him to call me to discuss.

Mario mentioned that there is still some debate as to whether the contracts should be under Japanese or US law etc... This was something that they were debating about 3 weeks ago.My understanding was that international contracts would be used. These are contracts that trading houses and investment banks would already be familiar with. Could you clarify the exact nature of the hold-up and get a date by which they will finalise this issue. The name of the legal guy is Mark Taylor. I d like to contact him directly some time to make sure everything is progressing as planned (after all, if we don t have the contracts ready, noone can trade)* Help deskIt is not a good idea to totally rely on the Houston help desk for EOL (especially during Japanese business hours). It took them about 4 minutes to get a translator. Using the translator was time consuming (also remember, international call), the translator was quite rude....and, in any case, I agree that there should be some support on the ground (demonstrate Enron commitment to Japan)Please feel free to give me a call. I m at the Okura on +81 3 3582 0111To: Joseph P Hirl/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Rousseau Anai/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: EnronOnline - JapanJoe,After extensive probing I discovered that the marketing materials EOL has planned cannot be delivered in time for our plans.  I can think of a number of alternatives for addressing this problem, including: changing brochures to one that can be more easily produced, changing printing firms and/or locations, and delaying the launch date until the following week.  At least one person at EOL suggested that we have a "press conference" on May 10 and then send out the materials.  I do not think this is an acceptable approach because it wastes the opportunities from the Nikkei interview on April 10, the higher profile McDonald/Hirl interviews during last week of April and buzz from counterparties receiving the packet.There appears to be a pervasive misunderstanding of our strategy and timelines.  To correct this, I have asked for a meeting with all of the interested parties (except Louise) on Monday afternoon.  We WILL walk through every step of the marketing plan and ensure that we have buy-in and accountable parties for the parts of the process that are outside of the control of Enron Japan.  After the meeting, I will let you know where we stand and what we can reasonably expect.  If we cannot resolve everything, I ll confer with you before taking it up with Louise.JohnPS Please note the following exchange.

I look forward to our getting together to nail down the details while there is still an opportunity to make necessary adjustments. On the subject of cover letters, there are several reasons for our approach:Given the urgency of completing the necessary pieces of the  mailing, it is more expedient to include two letters than to go through approvals on a new joint letter.We want our counterparties to understand that there are two avenues of communication into Enron - EnronOnline (initially in English) for its e-commerce platform and Enron Japan for a host of Japan specific business lines.  It is important that we position them as separate but complementary.  It s very easy for people in this market to confuse multifaceted business interests.  To be effective, we need to direct them to the appropriate sources/authorities.At this point EnronOnline will only be available in English, so potential users would need to be able to read your letter in English anyway.  However, in following Japanese protocols, many of the packets will need to be sent to higher level officials, who would then pass the packet on to the end users.  These are the people that we need to notify of Enron s Tokyo office and that EnronOnline is one of the many products and services available through Enron.  It is essential that this higher audience have the name of just the top Enron official in Japan, otherwise they may think that they should bypass the Enron Japan office and always go to Houston.  (In this culture it is a real risk.)  This would  jeopardize Enron s strategy for Japan.I hope the above mentioned considerations are helpful.  I look forward to discussing this further when we meet Monday.John   David Forster@ECT03/31/2000 07:11 PMTo: John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRONcc: Mario Parra Cardoso/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kal Shah/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Japan  John,It seems strange to me that we will not be translating the cover letter.

Peter Quine s letterhead (re: letter received by V&E 11 Aug 2000) shows an apparent company name of  e-nvironmental trading .  Yet, interestingly, the squatted enronmetals.com website has references per Fig. 1 below to: -  WE ARE ENVIRONMETALS  - appears upon mouse-over of the faux logo   ENviRONMEnTALS.COM  -  Manufactured Metal Miscellany  If Mr. Quine were acting in good faith, I believe he should have a good explanation for the what the connection might be between  environmentals trading  and  manufactured metals miscellany .   Is he concerned with environmentals or environmetals ?  (Please See Figure 3 and comments below to see the rather dubious connection between the two.)Fig. 1 - www.enronmetals.com - homepageFigure 2 -  Contact Us  page- This is misleading/misrepresentative since users would be led to believe that they may be contacting Enron Metals (vs. e-nvironmental trading) when they are invited to send email to :    anyquestions@enronmetals.com Figure 3 -  About Us  page- contains text:  We are a Brighton based group whose aim is to bring togethermakers-suppliers-collectorsof environmentally-friendlymetals objets In addition, I checked on the register.com site and found that the website:  www.environmetals.com  has NOT been registered to anyone and is still available for purchase.  I would argue that if Peter Quine were acting in good faith, he would have already purchased this name .Also, can you contact EasySpace, the host/ISP for both enronmetals.com and enronmetals.co.uk to instruct them that the names are in dispute so we can have the .com site suspended?  The enronmetals.co.uk site simply calls up a  holding page  at the moment:EasySpace can be reached at:Technical Contact, Registrar:   "Mr Easyspace Hostmaster" <hostmaster@easyspace.com>   Phone: http://www.easyspace.com/   Fax:   +44 1932 350 222(For the .co.uk  name, I believe Nominet (http://www.nominet.org.uk/) will have to authorize the ownership transfer, whereas for the .com name, EasySpace should be able to handle the transfer).

18809,tedbockius@spherion.com,taylor@enron.com,"Nov. 26, 2001, 11:30PMSizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limboBy MARY FLOODCopyright 2001 Houston ChronicleWhether troubled Enron Corp. merges, falls or stays the course, it is likelyto deeply affect one of Houston s largest law offices: the one within theembattled company."We ve always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston," saidHoward Ayers, managing partner of Andrews & Kurth, one of the city s largestfirms with about 240 lawyers in Houston alone.Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said.That s a large legal stable even for a company with more than 25,000employees. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm itwould have been the city s sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle 100survey released in May.Energy trader Enron s internal law office has burgeoned along with the hugetrading firm, now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor,Dynegy. As Enron s stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumorsit might drop out and leave Enron to face a possible bankruptcy.Whatever the company s fate, there are rough waters ahead for Enron lawyers.Although most lawyers interviewed said they hope everybody remains employedand that it is premature to discuss the fate of Enron s legal staff,speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens oflawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron willhold on tightly to its talent."My guess is they ll need their lawyers while they get things in a moresteady state. There s a lot of legal work to go through," said Joel Swanson,a senior partner at Baker & Botts, a Houston law firm with about 265 lawyershere.Not only does Enron have a large cadre of lawyers inside its company, but italso has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last fewyears. Several of the biggest Houston firms are working on the merger foreither Enron or Dynegy, and others are standing by wondering which outsidefirms will get the biggest pieces of legal work when the new company iscreated.Enron s legal department has siphoned talent from Houston s top law firmsover the years. Heads of law firms said they have seen plenty of promisinglawyers lured away by Enron s competitive pay combined with stock options,which were a lucrative draw until recently, as shares have lost 95 percentof their value."Enron has one of the premier legal departments in the country," said JeffLove, managing partner of Locke Liddell & Sapp, a Houston-based firm withabout 175 of its lawyers here.Enron has hired a lot of what are called "laterals," or lawyers who have hada couple years training, often at a big firm.Although jobs in corporate counsel offices are generally considered easierthan big-firm life, that s not the reputation of Enron s legal eagles.As with the company itself, the general counsel s office has been known asinnovative and hard driving."I don t think anybody lateraled into Enron with the expectation of anordinary life," Ayers said.In the Houston market, where big-firm first-year lawyers start at around$110,000 a year, the advantages of going to an expanding company like Enronwere the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company.If heavily anticipated layoffs occur at Enron, top Houston lawyers expectcasualties to land on their feet. Looming recessions are not always bad forjob-hunting lawyers. Bankruptcy, litigation and mergers all can boom inrough times.Several Houston-based law firms said they have recruited a slightly largerstarting class of lawyers for 2002, meaning they don t expect to scale backtheir business in the immediate future.Should the merger succeed, Enron s 245 lawyers will join Dynegy s 43."The question of how you integrate the two staffs, as with a lot of thingsassociated with the merger, won t be worked out for some time," Dynegyspokesman Steve Stengel said."

I had no problems but I think you should just assume that from the Newark airport it s at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit more.  The Avis lady didn t bat an eye; of course I stood towards the back of the car so she wasn t really looking at the front and there was a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.

For regular ERMS books (not Intra Month book),  first we get the promptDt, promptDt := TO_DATE( 01 ||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt, J ),1),  MONYYYY ),  DDMONYYYY ); Then if p_commodity_cd =  NG , we go get the cutOff date,  SELECT exp_dt           INTO expDate           FROM egs_expiration_dates         WHERE expiration_rule_cd =  Natural Gas Futures              AND ref_period_dt = promptDt; IF (TO_DATE(p_effDt,  J ) > expDate) THEN        cutOff := ADD_MONTHS(promptDt,1);      ELSE        cutOff := promptDt;      END IF; The strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs table, is computed using the following DECODE statement, DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt, J )) - TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(cutOff, J ))),-1,-2,NULL). Positions with strip flag as -2 will be rolled off by V@R program.2.

Hasselbeck, who has a pulled left groin, practiced Wednesday, but sat out Thursday s practice. Reidel Anthony <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1860&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01Anthony practiced Wednesday despite a left shoulder contusion, and he is expected to play Sunday at Tennessee. However, he hasn t been a main receiving threat for the Bucs this season, so don t use him in a Fantasy league. Dave Moore <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1369&>, TE TB - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01Moore missed Wednesday s practice with a right ankle sprain, but is expected to play in Sunday s game at Tennessee. He hasn t proven a reliable Fantasy tight end thus far, so don t use him this week. Jacquez Green <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=12405&>, WR TB - DRock s Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01Green did not practice Wednesday due to an injured left groin, but he is expected to play Sunday in Tennessee. We don t recommend you use him against the tough Titans secondary this week.Warrick Dunn <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/11/01Dunn participated in light running drills Wednesday and could practice Thursday or Friday, according to the St. Petersburg Times. Provided he has no problems with his sprained right foot, Dunn could play Sunday in Tennessee. We don t recommend you take your chances, and instead only use Dunn this week if he is clearly going to get the majority of the carries at running back. Antonio Freeman <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1226&>, WR GB - DRock s Beaatchs Updated 10/11/01According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, talk out of Packers practice is that Freeman will get more passes thrown his way in the next few games. We re not convinced Brett Favre will stop throwing the majority of his passes to Bill Schroeder as long as Schroeder remains productive, but there s a good chance Freeman might yet be able to help Fantasy teams this season. Just don t start him against the stifling Ravens defense this week. Shawn Jefferson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01Jefferson is dealing with both neck and back injuries, but he has returned to practice this week. He lacks the consistency to help Fantasy leaguers on a regular basis, so avoid starting him if possible. Chris Chandler <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01Chandler, who suffered a mild concussion last week, is expected to start this week for the Falcons. Michael Vick, however, still might appear in some short-yardage packages.Patrick Jeffers <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1515&>, WR CAR - C-Dawg s Boyz Updated 10/11/01Jeffers might finally return to the Carolina lineup this week. He is close to full speed, says the Charlotte Observer. "He s still working his way into being ready," Seifert said. "He s starting to capture my imagination." Marcus Robinson <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1676&>, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 10/11/01Robinson participated sparingly in practice because his surgically-repaired back remains sore from playing on artificial turf last Sunday, according to the Chicago Sun-Times . He isn t on the Bears  injury report, and we think he ll have a solid Fantasy week. Feel free to use Robinson if he doesn t suffer a setback.Shane Matthews <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01The Bears listed Matthews as questionable for Sunday s game against Arizona with a rib injury. He will serve as the No. 3 quarterback at best, so don t use him as a Fantasy starter right now. Fred Baxter <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1355&>, TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01Baxter is listed as questionable for Sunday s game against Arizona with a hip injury. He s a questionable Fantasy player to begin with.Damon Washington <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=146364&>, RB NYG - Blue Balls Updated 10/11/01Washington (shoulder sprain) practiced on Wednesday. As of now, it looks like he might be asked to start at halfback against the Rams. Ron Dayne <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01Dayne (neck) did not practice on Wednesday. Right now, it does not appear that he will play against St. Louis.Tiki Barber <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01Barber did not practice on Wednesday. He is listed as questionable for Sunday, and as of now, it does not appear he will play against the Rams. Frank Sanders <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 10/11/01Sanders did not practice on Wednesday because of a quadriceps injury. His current status is day to day.Robert Thomas <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=134236&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01Thomas suffered a lacerated finger during practice on Wednesday. However, the Dallas fullback is probable for Monday s game against Washington. Thomas has no real value as a Fantasy player. Saints <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=18&>, DT NO - Team Chick Updated 10/11/01Defensive end Joe Johnson could miss Sunday s game against Carolina with a strained left quadriceps. He ll be listed as doubtful, but there is an outside chance that he ll play. New Orleans faces a mediocre team in the Panthers this week, which makes them worth starting as a defense Fantasy-wise. Matt Hasselbeck <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/11/01Hasselbeck (groin) has started taking the snaps with the first-team offense and is listed as probable on the Seahawks  injury report. Although no official decision has been announced, a healthy Hasselbeck would likely get the start over Trent Dilfer this week. Terrell Davis <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/11/01Davis returned to practice and worked with the scout team. He is making cuts without pain, and there is a chance he could return in early November. "I m not going to put a target date on it," Davis told the Denver Post. "I m just going to go through this week, evaluate it and see where I am at the end of this week, and we ll go from there. Derrick Alexander <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1191&>, WR KC - C-Dawg s Boyz Updated 10/11/01The Kansas City Star says the Chiefs are preparing to play Sunday s game without Alexander, who still has a back problem. "It s not structurally damaged from a nerve standpoint, but they can definitely see why there is some soreness from the MRIs," Dick Vermeil said. "He s just got to work through it." Chris Thomas will probably start in Alexander s place. Reggie Wayne <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=235256&>, WR IND - Orange Roughy Updated 10/11/01Wayne might be asked to make his first pro start this week. Jerome Pathon is expected to sit out with a foot injury, and Terrence Wilkins is questionable with a rib problem. Newly-signed Tony Simmons might work as the third receiver. Terrence Wilkins <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01Wilkins is questionable for Sunday s game against Oakland with a rib injury. Jerome Pathon (foot) might also sit out, leaving Indianapolis thin at wideout against the Raiders.Mike Vanderjagt <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=12783&>, K IND - C-Dawg s Boyz Updated 10/11/01Vanderjagt has not kicked since having a toenail removed last week. But he is expected to play against the Raiders on Sunday night.Terry Glenn <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1254&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01Glenn has returned to practice. The Patriots are not sure when he will be ready to play, but might have a good indication of his progress by the weekend. John Hall <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1705&>, K NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/11/01Hall left practice with a back injury. His current status is day to day, although there are no plans for an MRI.Derrick Mason <http://football209.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=734&key=1816&>, WR TEN - C-Dawg s Boyz Updated 10/11/01Mason worked out in the beginning of practice Wednesday but his ankle was so sore that he had to stop.

"Eddie was better by the end of practice. He is still sore," head coach Jeff Fisher told The Tennessean. "He is doing more than what I thought he would do considering where he was after the game." Fisher also added that George would be a game-time decision if he doesn t practice on Thursday or Friday. The Titans will use Skip Hicks and Mike Green in his place if George is inactive.

24855,phillip.k.ellen@enron.com,rlehmann@yahoo.com,"Reagan,I am still reviewing the numbers but here are some initial thoughts.Are you proposing a cost plus contract with no cap?What role would you play in obtaining financing?  Any experience with FHA 221(d) loans?  Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market quotes lower yet.  I have received estimates structured as follows:  5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment  2%- overhead  4%- profitI just wanted to give you this initial feedback.  I have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project.  As you can see even reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%.  I am not thrilled about such a low return.  I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%.  Any ideas?I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you local connections.  I am not discounting those services.

25152,phillip.k.ellen@enron.com,jeffrey.hodge@enron.com,"Liane, As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.  A single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows: 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.  2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and        October gas daily.  It doesn t make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different. I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70 s and these trades are outliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron s belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index. It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me anytime I can assist you towards this goal.Sincerely,Phillip Allen"

They are as follows:1) Under Terms and Conditions, want to provide financial statements annually vs. monthly.2) Alternative Floating Price Structure:  We have included RISI as the back-up index should the OBM become discontinued.  Because their is a basis difference between RISI and OBM, we need to adjust the alternative floating price as RISI - $18.  RISI - $18 would replace DLK East - $10.  Thus there is an $8 difference between the two indices.3) Under Annex B1, the would like for it to read "either party (ENA or Tidewater Fibre) faces default situation" instead of Tidwater Fibre Corporation4) Under the collateral provision, instead of counterparty they would like "Tidewater Fibre and ENA"If you would like to speak directly with the counterparty, I can arrange that.ThanksErik"

("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EESI"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectivelysometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").  Wemake these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 withthe understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offeringto produce or producing documents, these entities have not waived anyobjections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims,defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses havebeen specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected fromdisclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges.GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense onEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entitieswill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show itscurrent organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directoriesor so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on itscorporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we canprovide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Datawill identify its customers and suppliers.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 11 The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, ESSI, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchaseand sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   We anticipateproducing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 andthe transaction data in the second wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are very small and there will probably be limited documentsavailable.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a schedulingcoordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, donot have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unitrequested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do havedocuments and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las VegasCogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave ofdocument productions. For Portland General, there will be a very large volume of documentsand we propose to handle them differently.  First, Portland General willprovide for year 2000 electronic data in summary form similar to the databeing provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant.  With respectto specific generating cost data, because of the volume, we suggest thatthese documents be made available in Portland for inspection from arepresentative sampling of facilities.  If there are specific documents thatthe Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss thearrangements for producing these documents.  We propose to make thesedocuments available in Portland in a third wave of document productionsTRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequest 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data foryear 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity,delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is purchase or sale.   Becauseof the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that someentries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those transactions where EPMIserved only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO willshow part of the transaction, but there will not be a correspondingtransaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.  The reason is thatthis type of transaction is passed through to EPMI s customer on anaccounting system rather than as part of the trading business.  EESI canalso provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will notinclude the specific names of its retail customers but instead will providea blind customer number.  Many of ESSI s customers have agreements wherebythey must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give itscustomers the notice they require.  We anticipate producing the transactiondata in the second wave of document productions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions orcomments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Dayor myself.Brobeck Phleger & Harrison LLPGary Fergus=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

This case was=20tried in October 1996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.  =In=20the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated==20state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing==20to take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=ain=20times between 1978 and 1988.  The trial court certified a class action with==20respect to ratability claims.  On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20ruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=ed=20the case to the trial court.  The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,==20claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=e=20of limitations.  The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=nd=20factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.  Although no==20assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=se=20matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=r=20results of operations. On November 21, 1996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=l=20Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The explosion resulted in fatalities,==20bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.  San==20Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan), an Enron subsidiary, operated a=20propane/air distribution system in the vicinity.  Although San Juan did not==20provide service to the building, the National Transportation Safety Board==20(NTSB) concluded that the probable cause of the incident was propane leakin=g=20from San Juan=01,s distribution system.  San Juan and Enron strongly disagr=ee. =20The NTSB found no path of migration of propane from San Juan=01,s system to= the=20building and no forensic evidence that propane fueled the explosion.  Enron=,=20San Juan, and four San Juan affiliates have been named, along with several==20third parties, as defendants in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District=20Court for the district of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico=. =20These suits, which seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, busine=ss=20interruption and property damage, allege that negligence of Enron, San Juan==20and its affiliates, among others, caused the explosion.  Enron, San Juan an=d=20its affiliates are vigorously contesting the claims.  Although no assurance=s=20can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters==20will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or result=s=20of operations. Trojan Investment Recovery.  In early 1993, PGE ceased commercial operatio=n=20of Trojan.  In April 1996 a circuit court judge in Marion County, Oregon,==20found that the OPUC could not authorize PGE to collect a return on its=20undepreciated investment in Trojan, contradicting a November 1994 ruling fr=om=20the same court.  The ruling was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1=995=20general rate order which granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of i=ts=20remaining investment in Trojan.  The 1994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon==20Court of Appeals and was stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1=995=20order.  Both PGE and the OPUC separately appealed the April 1996 ruling,=20which appeals were combined with the appeal of the November 1994 ruling at==20the Oregon Court of Appeals.  On June 24, 1998, the Court of Appeals of the==20State of Oregon ruled that the OPUC does not have the authority to allow PG=E=20to recover a rate of return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan==20generating facility.  The court upheld the OPUC=01,s authorization of PGE==01,s=20recovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan. PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme==20Court.  On August 26, 1998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for==20review with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the==20Oregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20undepreciated investment in Trojan.  On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme==20Court accepted the petitions for review.  On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=ll=203220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=d=20investment in property retired from service was signed.  One of the effects==20of the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE==01,s=20recovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan generati=ng=20facility. Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon==20Supreme Court to vacate the June 24, 1998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=rt=20of Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=ver a=20return on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=n=20accepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.  The Utility==20Reform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the=20proceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of==20State sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=e=20new legislation on the November 2000 ballot.  The Oregon Supreme Court has==20indicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20elections.  Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.  Additionall=y,=20due to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict,==20with certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regardi=ng=20PGE=01,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.  Although n=o=20assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=se=20matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=r=20results of operations. Environmental Matters.  Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and==20local environmental laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations requi=re=20expenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=20operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating==20sites.  The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to==20result in increased operating expenses.  These increased operating expenses==20are not expected to have a material impact on Enron=01,s financial position= or=20results of operations. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a==20potentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant==20Site (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the==20Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=A,=20also commonly known as Superfund).  The manufactured gas plant in Decorah==20ceased operations in 1951.  A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20Decorah Site in 1963.  Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant= and=20sold the Decorah Site in 1965.  The EPA alleges that hazardous substances==20were released to the environment during the period in which Enron=01,s=20predecessor owned the site, and that Enron=01,s predecessor assumed the=20liabilities of the company that operated the plant.  Enron contests these==20allegations.  To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially=20responsible parties with respect to this site.  Under the terms of=20administrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted==20subsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly==20located.  Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November==201998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999. =20Enron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA=. =20Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with thi=s=20site. Enron=01,s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater=20remediation on a number of their facilities.  Enron does not expect to incu=r=20material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation."

We have set up a number which can only be called from Enron Mobile phones (37373), when you dial this number you will hear dialtone.  The dialtone is coming from the phone system at Enron House, you are then able to dial exactly as if you were at your desk, ie dial  9  and the number you wish to reach.All calls coming through this route will be recorded and can be retrieved by the telecoms team for playback / reference.We have also ensured that external people cannot dial this number from outside the building by using 020 7783 7373.Let me know if you want to issue a note as a General Announcement or whether you wish to handle the distribution of the number.Regards,Andyx37285Cindy Horn31/10/2000 17:37To: Andy Cowx/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Nigel Denty/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Who should I talk to on this one?

The potential for toll-fraud is something that we need to take into account.Regards,Andy Cowx---------------------- Forwarded by Andy Cowx/LON/ECT on 31/10/2000 17:02 ---------------------------Nigel Denty31/10/2000 16:41To: Cindy Horn/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Andy Cowx/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Who should I talk to on this one?

Iwould suggest that the communication, as written, could be used to implythat the candidate would be an Enron employee.  If possible, we should saythat GSP is an LLC that currently is owned 100% by Enron, because, as Iunderstand it, Enron is going to sell down portions of that facility.Thus, I want to manage the expectations that the person would be an "Enron"person.Could you please forward this message?Thanks.

If you could move your date at Maine up to that     week from the 29th, then we could convene after all three interview     trips and decide who we want to bring on-site.     I propose (based on Marty s suggestion) that we try to bring all our     leading candidates in for a mill visit on the same day (or perhaps one     day for Dec grads and one day for May grads, if we get that many     interested candidates), preferably the last week of November.  It will     be a busy day, but then we can knock it all out then.     Regarding your campus visits, we are looking for at least two process     engineers, December grads are fine (actually preferred at the present     time), and we should also look at environmental engineers if they are     available at the school you are visiting.  In order to hire two     process engineers, we probably have to bring eight in for a mill     visit.     Margo, is there any way we can get some GSPCLLC brochures or handouts     for Jim, Mary and Dave to use on campus?FYI, Houston Legal is recommending that we do not emphasize the Enronconnection.

Michelle, since the Plan is not administered centrally, it can be a challenge to learn what past practices were, especially if they differed from different work groups.  I ve have always recommended centralized administration because an ERISA plan is required to be administered uniformly and consistently in similar circumstances.   One place to check about past practices is Cynthia Barrow s group.  You may not know what all past practices were until the conclusion of discovery related to litigation.

I also like that they have made a decision to have ranking in the commercial groups.  It looks like they are being ranked to measure performance, not for compensation.  If so, then it would be nice for there to be some rough correlation to compensation.  If not, then what are the criteria for determining the bonus amounts?  If it is P&L and some other components, then let s specify what they are.  My biggest concern with all of this flexibility is that decisions will appear arbitrary with no clear basis for distinguishing between persons at the top of the bonus range and persons in the bottom. On non-commercial, will there be a further breakdown within the 80?  If so, will those correlate to bonus amounts?  If not, same question as above. I understand that market forces may drive many of these bonus decisions.  If so, then I believe that we simply should articulate them and be prepared to explain the bases for bonus payment amounts. Promotion process looks good. Assistants and clerks looks good, although it looks like OOC will decide bonus amounts.  If this is a fixed amount based on the rating, then that is ok.  Otherwise, if they are not pretty standardized, the same issues arise as above.  I I expect that the same kinds of questions will arise for all business unit plans. Hope this helps.

Over the past month we have been negotiating with the Vulcan investors to create a structure that benefits both Vulcan and Enron.  We have gone from a structure where Enron would own 100% of the company to one that includes some equity, debt, and marketing. We feel fairly confident that we are close to agreeing on a deal that will involve the following basic components:Enron will pay Vulcan $ 100 million cash for the following:         $  40 million will be to purchase somewhere around 18% to 19% of the equity in Triton Coal Company         $  60 million will be to refinance subordinated debt that Vulcan currently has with UBS (Enron will then provide financing of this $60 MM)        Enron will become the exclusive marketer for Triton coal and will receive a fee on each ton of coal sold (based on % of sales price)We have indicated to Vulcan that we can close this deal within 30 days of their notification of acceptance of our bid. Some final due diligence issues need to be addressed by Enron before closing. The attached file includes a list of due diligence items that we have requested that are still outstanding.  Many of these may not apply, now that we will not purchase the entire company. Once Vulcan has accepted our bid we will need to move quickly and will need to let Triton know what outstanding issues we have to resolve. Please review this list and let me know by Monday afternoon of any items that we do not require in light of the new structure of the deal.We will set meetings with many of you for Monday and Tuesday of next week to ensure a smooth closing process if we are selected.

While I am always supportive of more public statements pushing competition, neither I nor Enron can sign on to the letter.  First, I am concerned that having Enron sign on will distract from your messages.  Enron is a "hot button" in DC and will change the proper focus.In addition, I would argue that the recommendation for a national commission is out of place with the current timing of FERC and Congressional action -- which is imminent -- while a commission would delay action on the Hill and at FERC, thus supporting the forces against competition.  Let s not study this too much - we know what to do.  Move away from the commission.Also, I m not sure how providing federal grant money only to states that promote competition supports our efforts.  Making GA pay for PA is a distraction from the main fights at FERC and on the Hill.Finally, I would guess that more funds to FERC and other agencies will only be used to increase enforcement against those in the industry.  While Enron wants markets that work well, the core problem is that we haven t deregulated enough - not that markets aren t working. Also, I don t know where the recommendation numbers from the Bush/Cheney plan came from -- I think it was an earlier document -- there are no such numbers in the final printed version of the report that I have.If you want to talk, please let me know.Thanks,Jim"

However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:Some agreement regarding payment of Edison s undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who ve recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they ve left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet s nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we d consider his proposals.Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn t seem that forebearance would be off the table.We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he ll get back to me with Edison s reaction to our proposal; and we d get back to him on Edison s proposals.Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn t inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.Any comments folks have on 1) Edison s proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison s proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.Best,Jeff"

Upon further reflection, Chuck thinks that, in order for the law firm to provide a useful and informative document, the memo must be pipeline specific.  He thinks that he can prepare the memo within the time frame discussed (aiming for end of July 4 week but no later than mid-July), for about $30,000 (plus costs, estimated to be about $5,000).  However, in order to meet this time frame, they will need some upfront information.  Specifically:1.	Based on the three pipelines we discussed, they would like to get the FERC case docket numbers where FERC 	issued certificates for the particular storage facilities being considered.  Because these pipelines have many 	storage fields, it will save a lot of time and money to have these docket numbers up front.   The pipelines should 	have this information available.  If we cannot narrow down the facilities that we re looking at, the law firm s 		response memo will not be as useful and they may not be able to meet our timing requests.2.	Additionally, the law firm would like to have all of the settlements and side agreements that the pipelines have	entered into with its customers regarding the storage facilities at issue.  The law firm s analysis will be impacted 	by these agreements, and obtaining the settlements from public records would be time consuming and costly, 	and side agreements are not publicly filed.In order to access this information, it will be most efficient if our regulatory people meet with the pipelines  regulatory people to obtain the exact information that we need for the analysis.  Please let us know if this is doable.One last point, Chuck asked if we would know by Monday whether we want to engage the firm for the work.  I told him we won t know before Wednesday, and he said that is fine, but the longer we wait to engage the firm, the further we push the date out for when the firm will get us a final product.  Just something to keep in mind.Also, Donna s computer is broken and she cannot send emails, so she asked me to send this message about her follow up discussion with Henry May:  Henry May estimates that his firm can do the work for approximately $30,000.  However, he is making no promises about the result, and Donna got the impression that, even after we spend $30,000 for his analysis, his end result may be that we cannot do the deal.  Henry did mention, however, that a partner of his worked on a financing deal for Enron regarding Bamel Storage.  Robert Neustadter is looking into that transaction further.ThanksSarah"

53825,elizabeth.sager@enron.com,tim.belden@enron.com,"Attorney-Client Privileged CommunicationNot DiscoverableHi TimLeslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still have relating to PCA.  PCA went into bankruptcy in 1998.  At the time of PCA s bankruptcy, PCA owed  a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI s books, this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract provided for one  way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) and some funds from credit.  After netting all these amounts,  there is still a $600,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.  Based on the current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the $600,000  PCA receivable now, and in the unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,  we would then give such amounts received from PCA back to you.

I left you Rich Kinder s number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.  Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look at.  I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the development team, Enron brings the MW s and trading and Cinergy brings MW s, trading and operating expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work togther with regards to the trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman, Dave s assistant informed me that you were coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting.

First of all, the property tax payments for assessment years 2000 - 2009 range from a high of $590K to $490K and are not close to the numbers he feels are reflected by the schedule.  Property tax payments for any given assessment year in Mississippi are paid in January of the year following the year of assessment.  For example, the property taxes for the 2000 year assessment year are paid in January 2001 and the payment schedule reflects that ($591,200).  The other figure that shows in the column are property taxes for that year to be paid in the following year.The 15% ratio of assessment has been taken into account in the calculation and the payments for the year are total estimated taxes for the year including the payment-in-lieu-of taxes payment ("PILOT").The document for the PILOT agreement has been supplied to the Duke Property Tax Department.  Have Swati contact Kelly Voelkel for any information he needs.If additional information is necessary please contact me at X-30689.Warren."

This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron?s Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron?s stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron?s remaining management team to direct the company?s ongoing operations.I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world?s most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.Ken Lay"

The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building s backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.

Electricity Market Design Conference, March 25-26, 2002, Atlanta, GAPower Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference, March 26-28, 2002, Atlanta, GAAncillary Services Conference, April 10-12, 2002, Denver, CO Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment, May 14-17, 2002, Westminster, CO See blow for a brief description of each conference and the links to the conference brochures:  _____  Electricity Market Design ConferenceMarch 25-26, 2002, Atlanta, GeorgiaOVERVIEW This Conference will focus on how to design competitive electricity markets that maximize the benefits to consumers while at the same time maintaining the financial viability of companies participating in these markets. The brochure for the Electricity Market Design Conference, March 25-26, 2002, Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by clicking on the link below:<http://www.euci.com/pdf/MrktDesgn.pdf>  _____  Power Generation Asset and Portfolio Management ConferenceMarch 26-28 2002, Atlanta, GeorgiaOVERVIEWThis conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.  The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.  The processes of Asset management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link short term issues of the trading & marketing departments. The purpose is to show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset owner. The brochure for the Power Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference, March 26-28, 2002, Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by clicking on the link below: <http://www.euci.com/pdf/powergeneration.pdf>  _____  Ancillary Services ConferenceApril 10-12, 2002, Denver, ColoradoOVERVIEW As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability.  This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

Customers and regulators demand reliable service.  Stockholders require more return from capital expenditures.  Training and retention of capable employees has become a major concern.   Selection of the investments and expenses that provide the most return is a continuous challenge.  With increasing constraints, and more-demanding performance expectations, distribution managers need new ideas and concepts to lead their companies. "Managing Distribution in a Restructured Environment" focuses on solutions to the issues that have made electric distribution such a challenging business.   It covers a full spectrum of topics, from distribution planning, load management services, reliability, customer relationship management, and management of aging assets.   Details from case studies are presented from utilities around the country.  Leaders in the distribution business present both novel and proven concepts, which participants can take home and apply in their business.  Coupled with a pre-conference workshop "Maximizing Performance Under Budget Constraints" and a post-conference workshop "Implementing Reliability-Centered Maintenance to Reduce Costs", the conference gives valuable insights and the edge that participants need to be successful.

Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I ll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.Thanks for your help,Kim"

Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks toweave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in theirinitial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well asaddress the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs atlevels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to thepresent. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the curren=tphysical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westwardFT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to beserved off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodologyset forth in SoCal Gas  initial comments.  It includes North and Southsystem segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits forunprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made toencourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contract=sdedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision i=salso made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and togive priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in thesystemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strongsupplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as abasis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiaryhearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system onceimplemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decidewhether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it maybe responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipperand state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions beforetaking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has question=sbut does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation positionwill only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viablecompromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why itworks.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructivecomments.

Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.

EPA did not include the stain tube request for sulfur monitoring.  The methods that are currently listed are wet chemistry methods.  As we discussed, since the permit allows us to use an APPROVED, alternate method, we will need to submit this request at some time.  For the time being, since we want to receive this permit ASAP we should be able to accept the permit as is.2.  It is my understanding that the limits given on CO and NOx are based on ppm @ 15% O2 and not going to the full ISO conversion.  We may want to double check that with the agency.

The call was cordial.  A couple of items that came up worth passing on are as follows: There is some expectation in PG&E to decon the compressors.  They may not wish to do so right now but maybe soon.  There is also discussion of these being out of service for up to a couple of months.  I passed along the idea that it is probably best to simply monitor the situation and the PCB matters may well take care of themselves through routine maintenance activities and continued operation.  No official decon processes exist as far as were are aware.  There are no restrictions on their continued use exist at that location.  PG&E may be considering employee exposure or continued source of contamination as issues why they want to decon. We should expect to this to come up during the meeting.  I do not think that this type of decon would necessarily be in line with the standard for reimbursement under our operating agreement - which is "reasonable action, measured in accordance with commonly accepted standards of care and practice in the natural gas pipeline industry in California."  I m not aware of SoCal engaging in any such action even though their system was highly impacted by PCBs.   I did not bring this standard up but we should be aware of it and recommend monitoring before any decisions are made.  My counterpart did acknowledge that even when the Long Term facilities eliminated the delivery problem, that we may well have continued issues with respect to the PCBs in the station and the 15 miles of pipe downstream for some lengthy period of time.  PG&E did not appear to be contemplating any pigging or decon of this section of the system. PG&E may be looking for some more comfort on the question of "source control".  We have said that this situation is relatively unique to the Topock Lateral but we have had some minor hits elsewhere recently.  We should be in a position to explain why the remainder of the system is not a problem and even if it should be why the Long term facilities should be able to handle any concerns."

Are we still struck with no real sampling guidance for the turbine other than sample all surfaces for teh verification sampling???  Assume that we do not have large surfaces, only many, many small and/or irregular surfaces..???Susan Fernandez   12/10/99 01:38 PMTo: Louis Soldano/ET&S/Enron@ENRONcc: William Kendrick/OTS/Enron@ENRON Subject: PCB Decontamination of TurbineLou - Under the PCB Mega rule, self-implementing decontamination of PCBs (i.e., cleanup without verification sampling) is only available for PCB containers; movable equipment used in storage areas, tools and sampling equipment; non porous surfaces contaminated with mineral oil dielectric fluid; and air compressor systems.  40 CFR 761.79(c).  EPA has yet to provide written guidance on its PCB Mega Rule decontamination regulations.  Based on my reading of the regulations, a contaminated turbine must be decontaminated in accordance with the measurement-based decontamination methods.The measurement-based decontamination procedures are not prescriptive.  The simply require that the non porous surface be cleaned by a method that reduces the surface concentration to less than or equal to 10 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters if the equipment is decontaminated for unrestricted use or less than 100 micrograms PCBs per 100 square centimeters if the material is to be disposed of in an industrial smelter after decontamination. 40 CFR 761.79(b).   I assume that the most efficient method of "cleaning" a turbine would be to drain the turbine of all free flowing liquids and then wipe or soak all surfaces that were exposed to PCBs with or in solvent.If a solvent is used to clean the surfaces, the regulations require that it have a solubility of PCBs of 5% or more by weight (other parts of the regulations recommend Kerosene, diesel fuel, terpene hydrocarbons and a mixture of terpene hydrocarbons and terpene alcohols).  The solvent can continued to be used until it reaches a concentration of 50 ppm PCBs.  40 CFR 761.79(d).Once the surfaces have been wiped clean with the solvent, verification sampling can be done using the standard wipe test at locations on the turbine selected under Subpart P (which includes the sampling of small and irregular shaped surfaces).  If the measurements show the surfaces have been cleaned to < 10 ug/100 cm2, the equipment is available for unrestricted use.  40 CFR 761.79(b)(3)(1)(i)(A).Persons participating in the decontamination activities must use protective clothing or equipment to protect against dermal contact of inhalation of PCBs or materials containing PCBs and take precautions not to release PCBs into the environment from the decontamination area.  40 CFR 761.79(e).Written records of the sampling procedure used to verify that the equipment has been decontaminated and sampling results must be maintained for 3 years.  The regulations do not require that a written record of the procedure used to decontaminate the material be generated or maintained.  40 CFR 761.79(f).Decontamination wastes and residues that are generated by rinsing or soaking contaminated surfaces with solvent can be disposed of at their existing concentration, which means that hydrocarbon solvents used which contain <50 ppm PCBs can be marketed as used oil.  40 CFR 761.79(g).The non-liquid cleaning materials (e.g., rags) and personal protective equipment, regardless of concentration, can be disposed of at a municipal landfill, a industrial non hazardous waste facility, a RCRA subtitle C facility permitted to accept PCBs or a TSCA PCB disposal facility.  40 CFR 761.79(g)(6).Finally, notification to the EPA is not required.  Verification sampling procedures and analysis must be available for EPA review when requested.  40 CFR 761.79(f).A very simple procedure would be:1.  All persons participating in the decontamination activity must wear personal protective equipment that protects from skin exposure that prevents inhalation of PCBs. 2.  Drain turbine of all free flowing liquids.3.  Wipe all surfaces or parts the would or could have been in contact with liquids with rags soaked in clean, unused solvent such as Kerosene.  4.  Collect all personal protective equipment and rags used during the decontamination process in drums for disposal.5.  Collect all used solvent and appropriate containers (Drums?).  Collect sample of solvent and have it tested to determine disposal options.6.  Sampling cleaned equipment by collecting wipe samples at locations determined under Subpart P of the regulations.7.  If verification samples indicate equipment is contaminated at levels less than or equal to 10 ug/100 cm2 PCBs, the equipment is released for unrestricted use.  If samples indicate greater levels of PCBs, cleaning as described above must be repeated with follow-up verification sampling.Call me after you have had a chance to look at this.Sue"

The old structuring model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and will eventually have them on a daily basis.You will need special permission to access the files located in M:power2Options.

These are a few examples of many that are requestsfor generation being requested out-of-merit by the NYISO for NYISO security.In my limited understanding of the way SCD works I had thought that the onlyreason the ISO or a Transmission Owner would request generation out-of-meritis to resolve for a constraint or system condition that SCD could not (setme straight if I am off-base).Requesting generation out-of-merit to resolve for system security is aneffective method of quickly resolving for an out-of-scope SCD system problemand by definition will not set clearing price.1. What are the rules and procedures in place to request generationout-of-merit both for local (Transmission Owner) and ISO request.2. What other control actions have to be exhausted prior to initiating arequest for generation to be called on out-of-merit.3. Are the generation bids available to the requestor(s) prior to making therequest. (Is economics a consideration?)4. When load is available to be dispatched, will it be considered as acontrol action instead of generation?5. Is generation called on out-of-merit to resolve for DNI constraints.6. In particular for Gilboa it was my understanding that prior to requestingadditional generation from Gilboa that an emergency was to take place. Isthere another agreement in place between the NYISO and NYPA. Below is anexcerpt from the ICAP manual.4.4.2 Energy Limited ResourcesEnergy Limited Resources that are ICAP suppliers must be able to provide theEnergy equivalent of their claimed ICAP for four (4) hours each day. EnergyLimited Resources must bid or schedule in the Day-Ahead Market fortwenty-four (24) hours each day in such a way as to enable the NYISO toschedule them for the period in which they are capable of providing theenergy.An Energy Limited Resource must also provide the NYISO with informationconcerning the hours during which it will be recharging or replacingdepletedresources. Once the resource has provided four hours of Energy equivalentICAP, the NYISO will not call on an Energy Limited Resource during itsrechargehours, except in the case of an emergency."

In the past, EBS had included David on the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq (Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354	Jeff.Gooden@compaq.com	12/18/00 07:58 PM		 		 To: Kim Godfrey/Enron Communications@Enron Communications		 cc: 		 Subject: RE: Compaq / EBS Relationship Kim,Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, DaveSpurlin "Owns" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq s perspective.All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your lifeeasier.Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; Myreaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enronand Compaq.

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.Afterour meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as thepoint person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaqtodirect our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe orKentMajor.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional timewithDavid to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities andissues.EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to developthestreaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meetingthatthere are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and ServerSupplyAgreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS andCompaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the ProductandServer Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS hashadinternal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further ourrelationship.The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal frameworkforour relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until thosechanges are made:1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaqwasinvoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoiceamount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section3.0 onor before December 31,2000.2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,Compaq(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   Theunderstanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written noticeandpayment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a newcontractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBSstrongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaqbelieves that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we lookforward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and createstrategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354"

108077,enron.announcements@enron.com,all.employees@enron.com,"As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and distribution partners.We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service we created.However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment on-demand independently.We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you apprised of our progress."

112766,coo.jeff@enron.com,dl-ga-all_netco@enron.com,"With Ken Lay s resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron s management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron s current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron s wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron s entire management team once those become more fully defined.Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.Link to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html"
113142,wsmith@wordsmith.org,linguaphile@wordsmith.org,"dol (dol) noun   A unit for measuring the intensity of pain.[From Latin dol(or) pain.]   "Minutes later it was still a comfortable four dol--what did they do, shut   off the steam? Finally I removed my hand and examined my fingers: great   blisters on thumb and finger."   Richard Kopperdahl, Bettervue hospital, Village Voice, Oct 3, 1995.One doesn t have to know the unit of pain to realize that the unit of joyis not the dollar, or any other currency for that matter. We don t have tolook far to discover that some of the richest people on this planet arenot the most happy ones. Having lived in two not only geographic but alsoeconomically antipodal places, I ve met persons who were blissful and thosewho were miserable, but their conditions were hardly a function of money.Certainly it is good to have the means to pay for basic necessities, butafter that it s only a series of zeros in some account.English author Samuel Butler once said, "Words are like money; there isnothing so useless, unless when in actual use." We can t do much aboutcirculating money (which I hope you have plenty of), but we do try our bestto put words in actual use. This week it is those words that make one say,"I didn t know there was a word for that."                          -Anu.............................................................................Every child is an artist.

This is one of the policy issues we need to reconcile, not only internally in our region but also because of contradictory policy positions in other regions as well. This is one of the Agenda Items in our regulatory plan for 2000. We will establish a working group to look at the issue and the final outcome will be a position statement of what Enron stands for.  We know that our "flag themes" are competition and customer choices, but  we need to be more concrete on situations that require a "close system" as a pre-condition for infrastructure development, and then a position of a migration approach or milestones to provide greater access and customer choice.The context is that there are substantial differences in the stage of market, regulatory, and infrastructure development in the regions and specific areas within the regions ; from "greenfield distribution development opportunity" in the southern states of Brazil, to a more mature situation in Argentina and elsewhere.  We need to explore these differences and state what are we willing to defend. The answer "Brazil distribution system is close because it  is in the Constitution or in the concessions contracts" is not very uplifting. The position "All distribution companies have to allow for full access of all customers to their selected supplier" does not address the practical issue of greenfield development.   We need to develop a different answer. WE SHOULD NOT ASK OTHERS TO WORK UNDER RULES THAT WE WOULD NOT AGREE TO WORK UNDER!!! WE SHOULD MEAN WHAT WE SAY AND ACT AS WE SAY!!! In order to get an answer that would be accepted not only in our region but also globally; we need to explore this issue through a task force.  The first task will be to draft a recommendation and later to have it reviewed by Executive Management.The key people in our region for this are:Business Units heads:  Mike Guerriero, Rick Waddell/Orlando Pupin  (George Wasaff and Pete Wielder do you want to get involved now?)Gas Regulation:  Mike Smith, Guillermo CanovasOutside the Region:  Jane Wilson, (I am soliciting other names to get a input of other experiences in the USA. I will have them later on). We need to plan     for their time commitment.Mike Guerriero has a window of opportunity in Argentina because he is a new comer. In order to be productive and do it on a fast time table I would like you to organize the meetings and the inputs. Let s set a tentative target to get the draft out at the end of January . You need to consult with the other people, provide us with a propose plan  and make sure we set aside the time and get the time commitment.ThanksJoseMike G Smith12/10/99 12:05 PMTo: Michael Guerriero/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ricky Lynn Waddell/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, George Wasaff/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Peter E Weidler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Guillermo Canovas/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Gabrielle Bardet/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Full Unbundling of Distribution Companies in ArgentinaGuysWe should have a meeting to discuss the above topic. Mike Guerriero is proposing that the distribution companies in Argentina should fully unbundle, which would include that they get rid of the buying and selling of gas and that function would basically be borne by marketers. There are some other topics, but this is the one that needs to be discussed internally. I propose we have a meeting at 8am Houston time on Wednesday, December 15th  which is an hour before the risk committee meetings starts. If you cannot be there, I would appreciate you sending a representative for you. This topic needs to be decided quickly so that a package can be put together for the higher end of the government ready to go at the first of the year.Gabby, could you get a call in number for everyone and distribute to everyone?thanksmike"

We discussed the gas price policy, electric deregulation and the role that Enron has been playing and can play in all these matters.I pointed to him that Presidents Bush and Fox were geting together on February 16th and that President Fox has been declaring to the media that he will talk about a common energy policy with President Bush.  We agreed that it would be useful for Secretary Martens to Meet with Dr. Lay before the Presidents meet.  Fernando Alonso admitted to me today that Secretary Martens wanted to hear Mr. Lays opinion on this subject and perhaps recieve some advice with respect to talking points for President Fox with President Bush regarding energy policy.Secretary  Marten s  team(and now the Secretary himself) view Mr. Lay as an ideal communication link between the Mexican and the U.S. Governments for energy policy.  This is the reason why the Secretary wants to meet with Mr. Lay before the 16th.  Originally they had agreed on meeting on Feb. 12th at 9:00 a.m. Nevertheless, President Fox has asked that Secretary Martens to meet him in Mexico City on Monday the 12th which is why I got a call from Fernando Alonso asking if Mr. Lay could see Secretary Martens on Sunday the 11th between 3:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.  Secretary Martens has to be at a CERA dinner on Sunday at 7:00 p.m.Fernando Alonso, Dionisio Perez-Jacome, Undersecretary Niceforo Guerrero and myself will be meeting tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. to talk about electric deregulation.  They are expecting an answer from me by then.Dionisio Perez-Jacome president of the CRE (FERC equivalent) is going to be in Houston on Monday the 12th.  I would like you and Steve Kean to meet with him if you are going to be in town.  I would also like to organize a tour for him that day.

There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).  But, the soundbite on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the grid.  The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of re-regulation.At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective:How great of a threat is re-regulation.How might we respond.How likely is this issue to play a significant role in election politics?"

He believes Enron has done a masterful job of manipulating themarket.    2.  He believes it may not be too late for Enron, specifically KenLay, to use the Federal government to stabilize the market.

Below, Philip Davies reports on his conversation with the head of energy balancing at the Polish grid company.  While this is only one person s view, it should be an informed view.  And that view is that a balancing market, which should lead to trading, should be in place for 1 January 2001.  Even discounting for optimism, 1 April does not seem unrealistic.  There are still hard issues to be resolved regarding long-term PPAs and stranded costs, but given this informed, and bullish, view on when we might have a "market" in Poland, I wanted to provide you with this status report.

Highlights:PSE is ready to begin negotiations on a transmission agreement with Enron.  We were told to take up the issue with Mr Janiczek - director of Transmission Dept.  Rakowski was a bit vague on the nature of the contract (eg, OH or OHT) and timing but let s see how far and how quickly we progress with Janiczek.  (Following the entry into force of the interconnection ordinance on 27 October, we do have a right to such an agreement under conditions set out in the ordinance).Rakowski asked us to send an application to be included in PSE s balancing market rollout programme.  They will give us a specific code number and include us in test programmes and balancing market implementation developments.Rakowski characterised the Polish market as reaching "the point of no return" as of 1 January.  Certain key changes are introduced as of this date, notably: (i) distribution companies will become by definition "active" or "passive" participants in the balancing market.  Active will be those that have signed up to the new balancing market rules.  Passive  will be those that have not, who by default will be charged for their entire consumption at imbalance settlement prices (PSE will not recognise contracts notified by distribution companies that have  not signed up to the new rules; a few distcos anyway buy 100% from PSE eg, Slupsk, Czestochowa). (ii) he is saying that hourly balancing & settlement will be introduced (in terms of the necessary IT being put in place), although at the same time hourly data will be for information only at the start.   Settlement will remain monthly for some transitional period but not past 1 July.While he claims he recognises the limitations placed on traders (and the market s development) by the ("temporary") "balanced position" requirement on OHs, he offered no real justification besides PSE s desire to "control".General tone was positive, he expressed happiness to meet with supporters of competition (in contrast to distco resistance).  But his underlying tone implied -as we knew- that PSE intends the transition to move at a pace deemed reasonable by PSE, rather than being driven by participants insisting on their legal rights or by PSE delivering on its obligations in a timely manner.  Thus the need to stay on the case of him and his team as of now.  Justyna, Tomasz - let s see if we can find more precise details of the changes to be introduced on 1 January, try http://www.pse.pl/pl/osp/pre/index.html Philip"

Other than driving less or buying cars that use less gas, there wasn t much they could do. Airlines, which consume billions of gallons of jet fuel a year, also felt the sting as prices fluctuated. But airlines, unlike drivers, can use financial tools to ease the pain of volatile fuel prices. As airlines begin rolling out their fourth-quarter earnings reports in the next few weeks, those that "hedged" on fuel are likely to show better profits than those that didn t. Not only was that the case last year, but it will continue to be the case if jet-fuel and oil prices remain high. Gary Kelly, chief financial officer at low-fare Southwest Airlines in Dallas, says hedging is "insurance against a catastrophic rise in fuel prices that would put us at unacceptable earnings levels." Hedges aren t agreements to buy fuel. They are financial contracts pegged to the prices of oil and oil products, such as heating oil and jet fuel. If airlines buy the contracts at the right prices, they can collect cash to compensate them when jet fuel goes up. Successful hedging didn t stop airlines from raising ticket prices last year to help cover rising fuel costs. But, airlines say, the increases might have been higher without hedging. When the industry s fuel bill for 2000 is tallied, it is expected to be $13 billion -- 50 percent higher than the previous year s $8.5 billion, according to a recent report from airline stock analysts at Merrill Lynch. At the same time, the airlines used only 4 percent more fuel. If the industry hadn t hedged, fuel expenses would have been $2 billion to $3 billion higher, the analysts wrote. AMR Corp., the parent of Fort Worth-based American Airlines, the No. 2 domestic carrier, is expected to save $550 million alone because of its hedging, they noted. Airlines don t like wild spikes in fuel prices because they make it difficult to plan and they jeopardize profits. A consumer would face the same dilemma if one month s apartment rent was $600, the next it jumped to $1,200 and the next it fell to $800. That s similar to what airlines faced the past year as the benchmark price of jet fuel, which is made from crude oil, fluctuated widely on the spot market. It was above 88 cents a gallon in March, dipped below 66 cents in April, rose to almost $1.10 in September and was just over 78 cents the last week in December. Airlines hedge to help smooth out such ups and downs. Greg Hartford, vice president for fuel at Houston-based Continental Airlines, looks to hedging "to take volatility out of the market, not to second-guess it." There are a variety of hedging tools. Some, just like car or home insurance, require upfront premiums. Hedging can be done through futures exchanges, such as the New York Mercantile Exchange, or through institutions, including banks, investment houses and energy traders such as Houston-based Enron Corp. Hedging is about managing risk, said Bill Berkeland, manager of trading for Enron North America, an Enron Corp. subsidiary. Techniques to cope with fuel price risks have been around probably 20 years, he said, but airlines didn t adopt them until the last decade. Airline hedging has gained more attention recently because of jet-fuel price spikes, he said. Some carriers will be able to take victory laps for being smart enough to hedge, he added, while others will simply blame fuel prices for their earnings problems. Hedges are bought for specific amounts of product and time: 2 million barrels a month for the next three months, for example. They can be pegged to the prices of crude oil, heating oil or jet fuel. Continental generally sticks to three basic types of hedges -- swaps, caps and collars. Hartford outlined the way each works: ? Swap: A swap is one of the simplest types. It essentially locks in the cost of energy at a specific price for a certain time. No upfront payments are required. For example, an airline takes out a swap for 1 million barrels of crude oil at $25 a barrel for February. If the price averages $28 during February, the airline is paid $3 million -- the difference between $28 and $25 a barrel for the million barrels. But if the cost averages $22 a barrel, the airline must pay $3 million. ? Cap: With caps, airlines purchase "call options" that protect them when prices rise but don t penalize them if prices drop. Caps, however, require upfront premium costs, which are based on a variety of factors. For example, an airline buys a crude-oil cap at $25 a barrel for 1 million barrels for February. If at month s end, oil averaged $28 a barrel, the airline collects $3 million. If it averaged $22, the airline gains nothing but loses nothing. Its cost: the upfront price-per-gallon premium. ? Collar: A collar is more complex. It involves buying two different tools that create a price range -- essentially a minimum and maximum. The airline benefits if fuel goes above the range s high end but pays if it goes below the minimum. It can be set up so no premium is paid. Intuitively, it would seem to make sense for airlines to hedge on jet fuel. But the market for trading jet fuel isn t as liquid, or as strong, as the one for crude oil. So airlines look for something that correlates to jet-fuel prices. Heating oil is often best, followed by crude oil. There are trade-offs. Premiums for jet-fuel hedges are more expensive than those for heating oil. In turn, heating-oil hedges are more expensive than crude. But using crude oil as a hedge may not smooth volatility as much because of fluctuations in the relationship between crude and jet fuel. In the first part of 1999, when crude oil traded for around $12 a barrel, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines started buying hedging contracts pegged to heating oil as far as 36 months out, said Joe Kolshak, director of investor relations at the third-largest U.S. airline. Delta s strategy has served it well. For the quarter that ended Sept. 30, hedging, including premium costs, saved the Atlanta-based carrier from paying an extra $160 million in fuel costs, he said. Even with that gain, Delta still paid 37 percent more for fuel over the same period than the year before. For the Sept. 30 quarter and the four preceding it, Delta had net hedging gains of $600 million. Hedging gains also helped balance sheets at other airlines, including No. 5 Continental and No. 7 Southwest. Southwest s Kelly said the airline s hedging last year met its goal of protecting against catastrophic fuel-price rises. In the third quarter, operating profits rose $43.1 million because of hedging. During the same quarter, Continental gained $27 million from hedging. For 1999, it was $105 million. Hedging isn t without risk. Airlines can predict the wrong way and lose millions. And when prices are already sky-high, certain hedging contracts won t be attractive because they, too, are pegged to higher prices. "Hedging is not a panacea, and it s not the golden elixir that people might consider it to be," Continental s Hartford said."

State energy officials said the ruling wouldn t have any immediate effect but could precipitate a power emergency if the generator decided to take a plant off-line for maintenance. On March 21, citing "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened the California landscape," U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. imposed an injunction against Reliant Energy Services Inc., one of the nation s major generators. Houston-based Reliant controls approximately 3,800 megawatts, or about 20 percent, of the gas-fired generation capacity in the state, and Damrell found that loss of that production "poses an imminent threat." But Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted an emergency stay of the injunction, saying Reliant has shown "a high likelihood of success on the merits" of its appeal. While not spelling it out, the panel apparently bases its finding on the question of the courts  jurisdiction over the energy market. The panel directed that a hearing on the appeal be scheduled for the second week in July. The decision leaves California s electric grid more fragile, at least temporarily, according to the state Independent System Operator, which maintains and controls power transmissions. It gives the agency no immediate recourse if Reliant chooses to shut down any of its plants for maintenance, said ISO Vice President Jim Detmers. "It s not going to change anything overnight, and it s not going to change anything over the weekend," said Detmers. "But if Reliant decided on a unilateral action to take their units off for maintenance ... we definitely could have a system emergency." Reliant officials, when told of the ruling, took a conciliatory tone but declined to specify their next move. "Reliant ... has pledged to keep the lights on in California," said company lobbyist Marty Wilson, and "is still of a mind to want to cooperate." Without further comment, the appeals court judges cited a 1980 U.S. District Court decision. In that case, 14 cities sued Florida Power and Light Co., alleging that it was violating a number of laws in its sales of power and production of electricity. The judge found, however, that the Federal Power Act reserves oversight of interstate utilities exclusively to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. He ruled that only the commission may bring an action involving energy sales into federal court -- unless it is a request to review a commission order, and that goes directly to an appellate court. The lawsuit before Damrell was brought by the ISO to force Reliant and two other generators to respond to ISO s emergency orders for power, even though the agency is buying on behalf of two retailers that are broke and hopelessly in debt. Because Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison can t pay their bills -- about $14 billion -- some wholesalers want to cut off sales to the utilities. The other three defendants in the ISO s suit -- Dynegy Power Corp. of Houston and Tulsa-based AES Corp. and its marketer, Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co. -- have entered into written agreements with ISO to continue supplying emergency power until the FERC decides whether they are required to sell to companies that are not creditworthy. But Charles Robinson, ISO general counsel, points out that the generators can rescind those agreements with 48 hours  notice. "My hope is this is a temporary setback," said Robinson. He added, however, that the practical effect is "at least for now, we don t have a tool to compel them to do what we believe they re obligated to do" -- respond to emergency demands for power. Reliant has insisted since the suit was filed Feb. 6 that Damrell has no jurisdiction over the rate schedules that govern dealings between generators and the ISO, and that the Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must settle any disputes about terms of those tariffs. In issuing the injunction, Damrell acknowledged that the FERC has special expertise concerning agreements between generators and ISO. "Absent the extreme exigencies of the California power crisis, the court agrees that a stay pending further action by the FERC would be proper," he said. "But those are not the facts here. Electricity is in critically short supply. The health and safety of the people of California are potentially at risk." Immediately upon receiving the 9th Circuit s order Thursday, attorneys for the ISO asked Damrell to set an accelerated schedule for its motion to amend the suit. The agency apparently has crafted a new complaint stressing its view that the matter is an ordinary contract dispute over which the judge has jurisdiction. Damrell scheduled a hearing on the motion for Thursday. In a further development that could complicate the state s dire need for energy, an alternative supplier won a court fight Thursday to bypass the big utilities and sell its power on the open market. Timber giant Sierra Pacific Industries, which operates four biomass plants that produce power for PG&E, obtained a temporary restraining order in Sacramento Superior Court that says Sierra Pacific is not required to sell its power to PG&E. The ruling means PG&E and Southern Edison could lose power as alternative energy generators, fed up with months of nonpayment, sue to be able to sell their comparatively cheap product elsewhere, including outside the state."

Reuters	Boeing Sets 2,900 New Job Cuts Monday November 26, 1:36 PM EST SEATTLE (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA). on Monday announced2,900 job cuts, boosting its total since the Sept. 11 hijackattacks to 14,900 or nearly half the 30,000 jobs it has said itcould cut by the end of 2002.The 2,900 employees getting 60-day layoff notices on Mondayincluded 2,100 in Boeing s beleaguered commercial jet unit,where orders have shriveled as airlines park aircraft and cutdeliveries of new jets to match shrinking air travel demand,spokesman Tom Ryan told Reuters.Chicago-based Boeing said the latest cuts also include 700workers in its shared services group and another 100 mostlyfrom its embryonic Connexion airborne Internet service and itsJoint Strike Fighter program, which lost a massive Pentagonaward to rival Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT). last month.The latest 2,900 cuts include 1,900 jobs in the Seattlearea, Ryan said.Boeing in October announced 12,000 job cuts, which takeeffect on Dec. 14, and said it would ultimately cut a total of20,000 to 30,000 workers. The first round included 11,400commercial airplane workers and 600 from shared services.Boeing also redeployed 200 of 600 Connexion workers in lateSeptember as airlines backed away from the service and Boeingfocused on flight safety and security applications for thesatellite-based communications network.The aerospace giant has slashed projected deliveries fromits world-leading commercial jet unit to 350 to 400 in 2002from an expected 522 this year. In 2003 the forecast falls evenlower and some industry analysts believe the totals will falleven lower.Earlier this month Boeing Chairman Phil Condit predictedthe current travel slump would cost the manufacturer about1,000 jet deliveries over the next several years.Depending on size, Boeing jetliners sell for roughly $30million to nearly $200 million each. The company has said itneeds to shed workers to meet its stated goal of remainingprofitable despite the lost orders.Several airlines have already failed and others are said tobe teetering near bankruptcy in the wake of the hijackings,which boosted airlines  operating costs and left many of theirplanes half-empty.At the end of October, Boeing employed a total of 196,500workers and 91,600 in its Seattle-based commercial jet unit.The company expects to send out its next batch of 60-daylayoff notices on Dec. 21, Ryan said.?2001 Reuters Limited.

If there are any doubts regarding the level of committment that we need, I encourage you to visit with Mitch to reconfirm our priority and urgency.In summary, we have two quality sites and one less optimized area where we are going to focus in the near term.  The two quality sites are both subject to a "bid" process (Texas municipal political subdivision) and the respective counterparty s board approval,  We have no reason to expect that we wouldn t be able to secure the sites but it s going to take manpower and about 6 to 8 weeks - this time frame doesn t work for us.  Contemporaneously with working through the "bid" process for the two sites and in the near term, we re going to focus on a suitable site area, although not optimized, that will give us relatively quick site control and allow us to progress the coal initiative.  Our goal is to secure site control for the less optimized site by next Friday, the 4th of May.Here s a basic summary of our immediate site options and an action plan:1.) Less Optimized Site: (not subject to "bid") Bruce and I will contact regional land agents today to get a summary of available sites.  We ll  travel up to the region Monday afternoon to scope the sites on Tuesday.  We ll present an Option to Purchase offer to the respective land owner and secure, at a minimum, a Letter of Intent by the 4th of May.  Transaction needs to be in the name of an SPV.2.) Gibbons Creek This site and PRB fired facility is owned by Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA).  TMPA is comprised of Bryan, Garland, Denton, and Greenville.  Our intent is to secure a site for a 525 MW PRB fired facility, and enter into a Shared Services Agreement and O&M Agreement with TMPA.  There is interest on the part of TMPA and this transaction is in play, however it s going to take time.  Contemporaneously,  our immediate action is to gain some form site control on the land.  It has been represented to us that an option to purchase will be subject to the sealed bid process;  that takes too much time.  Our interest is to close the option to purchase or some form of site control within two weeks.  I m going to contact Carl Shahady, TMPA s attorney, to see if there is any latitude in the regs requiring a sealed bid.  You re more than welcome to participate.  (TMPA wants to use a standard Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC) form, which I have a copy of.)  Perhaps we can put a month-to-month "option" on the site, which effectively takes the property off of the market, while we go through the sealed bid process.  Legal questions:  (i) Any land transaction needs to be in the name of an SPV - which one should we use? (ii) Coal projects don t fit into Turbo Park,  I ve exchanged voice messages with BrianK to see what needs to be done here, any suggestions?3.) BPUB BPUB s Board approved the development LOI this past Monday, so we re ready to go.  The optimal sites are at the port, and the port is subject to the bid process.  The intent is to use the same form of option to lease contract as we used for the TEX/MEX sites at the port.  Again, this site control is going to take 6 to 8 weeks.  Aaron Roffwarg of B&P drafted the land contracts and he helped negotiate between John Davidson, BPUB s outside counsel, and Dan Rentfro, Brownsville Navigation District s outside  counsel.  I m going to contact Aaron this morning and get him spun up on the new contracts and have him call DanR to get him alligned with our objectives.  Your more than welcome to participate in my call with Aaron, too.  Scott and I are going to meet with BPUB and with the Port tomorrow to indentify the site and confirm our course of actionThat s the plan.  I ll be calling each of you this morning so that we can all get on the same page.Thanks,JMoore"

In addition, ComEd has included a cover letter which indicates a significant level of uncertainty regarding a  01 interconnect at Plano.  Under the guidelines of Appendix K of ComEd s Open Access Transmission Tarriff, we are required to execute this LOI within 15 days of the date of receipt (7/7/00) in order to maintain our current position (6/12/00) in the ComEd queue.  If we execute after 7/22/00, then the date our date in the ComEd queue becomes the date of execution of the LOI.Appendix K provides that once the LOI is executed, ComEd shall provide Enron with an Interconnection Study (IS)  and Project Diagram (PD) within 45 days (ComEd has the option to extend another 30 days, if needed).  The IS and PD will provide Enron with a description of the upgrades required and an estimate of the proposed allocation of the cost to interconnect.  The IS and PD do not provide Enron with information on transmission availability (ie ATC), this would be addressed by the Interconnection Feasibility Study currently in progress by ComEd (I am expecting the results of this IFS in the next 2-3 weeks).  ComEd informed me in a discussion yesterday afternoon that their current interpretation of AppendixK provides that if the commercial start date of a proposed IPP project is delayed, that there is no impact to that proposed projects  queue position relative to competing projects provided that all interconnection milestones (LOI, PD, Notice To Proceed, and IA) remain current.  ComEd further indicated that such a delay would result in a project with an inferior queue position (i.e. Wizvest) being charged with the necessary system upgrade costs even though their project would come on line prior to the project with the superior queue position.  I will request that this interpretation be confirmed by ComEd in writing to Enron. (This interpretation obviously has a large value implication for the Torrence site relative to the Wizvest planned  01 interconnect).I will review this letter on the plane to Houston this afternoon.  I believe that it authorizes ComEd to spend up to $100K on engineering related to the interconnect design.  It also addresses the ordering and payment responsibilities for long-lead equipment required to facilitate the proposed interconnection.  Based upon our development budget discussions earlier this week,  we obviously do not want to incurr long-lead equipment charges prior to having a clear value proposition in our sights.  I will have recommendations ready for you on these issues by Wednesday.  I am simaltaneously forwarding it to Kay Mann for her review so that we will be in a position to move forward to execution prior to 7/22 if we choose to do so.  From a legal standpoint, this is ComEd s boilerplate LOI.  I believe that we executed a similar LOI for Wilton Center in early 1999 under Des Plaines Green Land Development, L.L.C.

Assumption:Kilgore s objective:		Maintain PRM accounting treatment for the swap.Outcome of lawsuit:	 	Game Over for Kilgore if his accountants disagree with the current PRM treatment and move it to debt thus affecting his 					ratios and revolver.What do we want?(i) 	To be certain of payment - how important is this really?  Pretty important - but what is this worth is cash terms.  We clearly are in a position 		whereby if El Paso evers transfers the contract to an entity which defaults on payment we are exposed.  However,  realistically what are the chances 	of them defaulting - very low and, would we win that in court - Yes.(ii) 	To monetize the contract - secondary concern with a value to Enron of $15m.  There are potential ways that we could monetize the contracts 		without disclosing the contract - Joe is working on these.    If there is a way we can do this then our downside from this confidentiality issue is much 		smaller as it would cost us more to monetize (thereby bringing in less gain - probably not much of a difference) but can we get the asset off the book? 	We are pursuing how far we can get  in terms of  true sale  treatment with V&E - they will give Joe a view on Wednesday.  There are potential other 		ways we can ensure this is off our credit.If we sue them?  Loss of leverage.We potentially open up the issue to a much wider audience and potentially affect Kilgore s accounting treatment - the one thing he wants.  So our leverage has disappeared as we are no longer able to maintain the one thing Kilgore is looking for.Way Forward:We should continue to pursue a commercial solution to the payment issue and monetize the contract through a secondary route.  If we complete monetization through another route then we are exposed to non-payment which could be perceived as very low risk (we have potentially a one year exposure on the back end based on six years statute of limitations).  If we cannot get a way forward on the monetization , then re-review the way forward. We are at risk of them suing us over the confidentiality breach and that would be in New York.

(ENE), here s another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company s stock.Enron doesn t simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. That s a rare level for a company of Enron s size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can t place any further faith in the veracity of Enron s earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they ve been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. First, let s be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company s reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what s left over to shareholders. This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison s sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor s 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy s agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron s book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron s current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won t be consummated in its current form. But given Enron s current woes, it s certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don t feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years  worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) When you ve gotten punched in the face three times, it s not unreasonable to fear there ll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won t be. Given Enron s insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren t more such shocks yet to come? That s what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron s repeated demonstrations that its numbers can t be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. An Enron spokesman couldn t be reached for comment. It s ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it s hard to properly value Enron because the company s attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it s hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy. -By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover >ENE DYNBy Christina CheddarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES11/26/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc. s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy s board isn t offering its opinion. "Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company s executives," said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn t say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren t immediately available to comment or couldn t be reached. As for Dynegy s management, spokesman John Sousa said the company s opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal s offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won t get completed on its original terms. Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy s recent stock price. At Enron s recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron s pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron s near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Remond and Christina Cheddar11/26/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Of Dow Jones Newswires NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.The loan relates to one of Enron s consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor s downgrade of its credit rating to "BBB-" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron s $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. Enron s shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company s finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron s only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar. Carol S.

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To SwapsBy Christine RichardOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES11/26/2001Dow Jones Capital Markets Report(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. But investors shouldn t be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn t ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor s. As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don t possess actual Enron obligations - and won t unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron s rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor s and Baa3 from Moody s Investors Service. The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron s ratings. Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189; christine.richard@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. If proven, the sale without a prospectus "give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest," Gottesdiener said in a statement. Enron "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. -John Seward; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400 (Corrected 04:34 PM)Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	STOCKWATCH Enron falls 14 pct on mounting concerns over Dynegy deal11/26/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdNEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down 14 pct in midsession trading as concerns continued to mount over the energy giant s acquisition by Dynegy Inc, with investors focusing more and more on the deal s breaking clause, dealers said. At 12.45 pm, Enron shares were trading down 65 cents at 4.06 usd, a decline of 14.0 pct. Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank.The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99. Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. "People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that s there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage," said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. The deal with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm s former chief financial officer. "At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued," said Jefferies  Hogan. ng/gcCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify.By Janet McGurty11/26/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through. Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron."The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms," said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. "Escape clauses" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron s business or assets. "Dynegy has a good claim that the  material adverse condition  clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness," he said. Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. Enron s recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. "Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place," Heim said. "Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?" The majority of Enron s physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron s Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron s online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. "Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It s not the computer systems - it s the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.11/26/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers  stock through 401 (k) retirement plans. "How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked.Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts. The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status. Enron s shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees  401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan s administrator. Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. "Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans," he said. The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was "completely indefensible," he said. Gottesdiener s suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.11/26/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformedTreasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad revival for corporate bonds of all stripes. In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about 0.01 percentage point. "I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially with Treasury interest rates going up," said one trader. "Absolute corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive." Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic downturn won t be deep or long. "The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for risk," wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a report dated Monday. "While the severity and swiftness of the bond market s correction was a surprise, it hasn t changed our basic view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend overweight positions." This week s forward calendar remains quiet. In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their yields fell to 4.971 percent. ENRON Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured and coming due within 13 months. Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers believe, is Enron s banks. "The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve their risk-profile under multiple scenarios," said CreditSights. "The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 billion in bank loans," wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. "If Dynegy backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as the patsies." Enron s existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest level since early 1989. DATA Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month. For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders  Perfect Storm StallsBy Christina Cheddar11/26/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here s one 2001 outlook that couldn t have been more wrong.Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting "the perfect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001. Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry s largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. And the chance for recovery in 2002? Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market s median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It s just a matter of time before the stocks get there. "They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state s energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron." The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. "Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he said. "I don t think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility." Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies  strategies and financial disclosures. Enron s precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron s financial problems aren t solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. Answers Elude Investors Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it s a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn t easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn t liquid. Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. "All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not," he said. He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. Tim O Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). According to O Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. "We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are," O Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O Brien. "One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays," O Brien said. That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India s AV Birla group denies bid for Enron unit.11/26/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.(Recasts with denial, comments from financial institution in paragraphs 5-6) BOMBAY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Aditya Vikram Birla Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, on Monday denied newspaper reports it was looking to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp s 65-percent stake in the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company."There has been no expression of interest in Dabhol. We are not interested," a top AV Birla group official told Reuters. Two leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector. The Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron s stake in the company. An official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group. "We have not received any official communication from them," the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters. The spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment. FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL Enron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent. Dabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India s efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project. Tata Power Company Ltd, India s largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India s largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron s stake. The AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries. Last week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India s largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd Earlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France s Groupe Bull SA s 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems But the group s track record in the power sector has been less than impressive. Two joint ventures with Britain s Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron s Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)2001-11-26 16:45 (New York)Enron s Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)     (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. s stock pricedeclined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points onconcern the company won t secure $1 billion in fresh capital,threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.     ``The clock is definitely ticking,   said Jon KyleCartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``Thequestion is the survivability of Enron.       J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives mettoday to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bondsconvertible into stock. The company needs the money to operateuntil Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiledits plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron s6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on thedollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid forEnron has pushed Enron s stock down 55 percent in the past week.Enron s shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October afterthe company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and saidexpansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy salescost it $1.01 billion.     ``You haven t heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is abit scary,   said Andy Palmer, who doesn t hold Enron bonds in the$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. inWashington.     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limitedpartnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started aninvestigation into Enron s accounting. The company earlier thismonth restated its earnings for the past four years.                        Talks on $1 Billion     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegyshare for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21percent more than Enron s share price that day.     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, morethan double Enron s closing price of $4.71. The widening of thedifference between the value of the offer and Enron s stock priceindicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding toclose at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. tradingWednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to$39.25.

Dynegy Chief Executive Officer ChuckWatson said he was ``encouraged   by the commitment to extend thenote payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million creditfacility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the firsttime in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it hasless than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If thecompany s cash reserves run too low, Enron s credit rating may becut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion indebt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might behurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as AquilaInc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enronbecause of credit concerns.     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don t view itlikely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alonecompany,   Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, thecredit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry upfurther.

Dynegy s 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, accordingto Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return tocompensate for the increased risks of the securities.     Dynegy s credit is rated ``Baa3   at Moody s InvestorsService, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+   atStandard & Poor s, two levels higher. Each ratings company said itmay cut Dynegy s credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes withabout $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financialpartnerships set up to keep debt off its books.     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have adetrimental effect on Dynegy s credit rating,   said Tim Nelson,senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. inMinneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.

Enron s credit is rated ``Baa3   at Moody s and ``BBB-   atS&P, the lowest level of investment grade.

More than 60 million shares changedhands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced anagreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its valuein the past month.Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to standat $39.25.The collapse in Enron s share price has made it more likely that Dynegyand Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, inwhich 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstandingEnron share.However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident ofits ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500million in private equity capital to shore up its finances."We continue to hear reports the Enron s energy marketing and tradingbusiness, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly withcounterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals," A.G.

New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggestenergy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 millionloan, ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cutoff from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

Earlier this month, Moody s Investors Service placed all $13billion of the company s long-term debt securities on watch forpossible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,any drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial papermarket and raise the costs of short-term debt.     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to boththe capital markets and our counterparties,   Enron s ChiefFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,giving it enough cash to operate normally.

Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying twopartnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow s leadershipof them was a conflict of interest.     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliatedcompanies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnershipswould cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, RayNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report toinvestors.     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buyand sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on itsbooks.

(ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. The procedures were "rigorously followed," Lay said. In previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were "reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties." Fastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. During the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. Lay said the company would be providing a list of "Frequently Asked Questions" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company s stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. Lay said he was "extremely disappointed" in the current stock price. "Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business," he said. During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow s role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. Enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. Under certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron s stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. Enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a "worst-case scenario." However, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. Moody s put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. According to Lay, Enron s debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. "We are committed to maintaining our ratings," Lay said. "Moody s said they would work with us," he added. Furthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have "sufficient liquidity" to meet all its capital requirements. Enron s efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron s Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn t affect the company s earnings outlook. Enron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. "Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that," Lay said. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron says shareholders   best interests  were sought in all LJM dealings10/23/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdNEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp said it sought the "best interests" of its shareholders in all its dealings with LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, two partnerships which were set-up and run until recently by Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. "The board (of Enron) was fully aware and kept a real Chinese wall between Enron and LJM. Enron s shareholders best interests were sought in all LJM dealings," said Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay, in a conference call with analysts.The company scheduled the call after Enron s stock slid 21 pct yesterday, when it revealed the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions. Overnight, two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against Enron and its officers, alleging that operating results were also "materially overstated" as a result of the company failing to timely write-down the value. In its third-quarter results last week, Enron announced a charge of 1.01 bln usd, of 1.11 usd per share, and an incremental 1.2 bln usd reduction in stockholders  equity, related to the unwinding of investments with the LJM partnerships. According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow resigned from the partnerships in July, due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests. During the call, Lay said that he, and Enron s board of directors, have "the highest faith and confidence in (Fastow)." Lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations, and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating. Analysts have raised the possibility that, should Enron s credit rating and stock price continue to fall, the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with. ng/cml For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

US class action suit filed against Enron for misleading statements10/23/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdNEW YORK (AFX) - Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against Enron Corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between Jan 18, 2000 and Oct 17, 2001, thereby inflating the company s share price artificially. The suit was filed on behalf of Enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the US District Court in Houston against Enron Corp, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned recently, and Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. The suit claims that Enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy.The company s operating results were also "materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships" managed by the company s CFO. The suit additionally alleges that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On Oct 16, Enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non-recurring charges of 1.01 bln after-tax, or 1.11 usd per share, which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron s chief financial officer. Enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd. Enron s share price consequently fell sharply.

All Rights Reserved.NEW YORK - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20% yesterday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. A spokesman for North America s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating.The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry. Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron s chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took US$1.01-billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after six months at the helm. Enron shares declined US$5.49, or 21%, to US$20.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shaving off almost US$4.2-billion of its market capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8% yesterday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC s inquiry into "certain related-party transactions" involved the partnerships. "Related-party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy- and communication-related investments. The Journal reported US$35-million of its third-quarter loss of US$638-million were connected with the limited partnerships Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron s use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously. "Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron s credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said. Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. "This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron s attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. "It s easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one." The price of shares in the company is down 75% this year.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	City - SEC inquiry sparks Enron share fall.By Simon English.10/23/2001The Daily TelegraphP31(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001in New York ENRON, the American power giant, saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow.The Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which Mr Fastow has, or had, links. Enron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement: "We welcome this request. We will co-operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." Questions were raised last week on Wall Street after the company announced a write-down of more than $1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses. The disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23pc. Yesterday they fell another $5.30 ( #3.80) to $20.75 in early trading. According to the annual report the "related party transactions", as Enron describes them, took place in 1999 and 2000, resulting in losses of $16m and $36m respectively. Mr Lay said that auditors approved the deals, but would not give further details of what they were. They are understood to have been hedging transactions against Enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment JP. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," added Mr Lay. The relationship between the investment losses and the SEC probe is not clear, though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions. Enron owns Teesside Power Station and Wessex Water in Britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the US. Investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company s credit rating. An Enron spokesman said Mr Fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion. The SEC inquiry is "informal", says the company. The watchdog contacted Enron last Wednesday, the day of the results announcement. The SEC declined to comment. Enron made a loss of $638m in the third quarter, its first in over four years.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	Business; Financial DeskShares of Enron Plummet 21% Energy: SEC requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive.NANCY RIVERA BROOKSTIMES STAFF WRITER10/23/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionC-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyShares of Enron Corp. set a 52-week low Monday on word that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the Houston-based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive. Enron, the world s largest energy trader, said it had voluntarily provided information on "certain related-party transactions" that had been previously disclosed to the SEC."We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest," he said. The SEC request is the latest in a parade of bad news for Enron, which has seen investments sour in telecommunications, retail electricity sales and water. Investors have battered the company s stock, which once sold for nearly $85 a share in the last year, and many have criticized Enron s stingy meting out of financial information. But several Wall Street analysts remain upbeat on the stock, noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn. In August, Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, one of the main architects of the company s strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit, stunned Wall Street by resigning. Skilling cited personal, family-related reasons, but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company s stock price contributed to his departure. On Monday, Enron shares plunged $5.40, or nearly 21%, to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron s stock has lost nearly 40% of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third-quarter loss of $618 million after $1.01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments. But the charge also included $35 million related to what Enron described only as the "early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity." In a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings, the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions. But investors were stunned when stories last week in the Wall Street Journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron s chief financial officer, and that Enron had whittled $1.2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $1.2-billion note it had received from the partnership. Shareholder equity now stands at $9.5 billion. The limited partnership, called LJM2, and Fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved Enron assets and stock, the Journal reported. Lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed. A shareholder lawsuit charging that Enron s directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in Texas state court. Many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes, but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them, analyst say. Investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that Enron has guarded financial information, making it difficult to analyze the company s complex web of businesses. And many are not confident that all the bad news has been released. Analyst M. Carol Coale, who follows Enron and other energy companies for Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron to a "hold" from a "buy" rating Monday out of such frustration. Coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of Enron. But Bob Christensen, energy analyst with First Albany Corp., said that despite Enron s recent difficulties, the bulk of the business remains strong. "I continue to tell investors that 70% of this company s business is growing at a 26% rate, and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on," he said. Investors are panicking because of a "bad news story that doesn t reflect reality," said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with the Raymond James & Associates brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, Fla. "They are the world s largest energy trader, and they are very good at that," Cartwright said. "The reality is that everything is fine here," although more charges, perhaps $500 million worth, are expected in the next few quarters, related to businesses that Enron is selling.GRAPHIC: Losing Its Spark / Los Angeles Times; Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It s my job to have something to say. They pay me to provide words that help make sense of that which troubles the American soul. But in this moment of airless shock when hot tears sting disbelieving eyes, the only thing I can find to say, the only words that seem to fit, must be addressed to the unknown author of this suffering. You monster. You beast. You unspeakable bastard. What lesson did you hope to teach us by your coward s attack on our WorldTradeCenter, our Pentagon, us? What was it you hoped we would learn? Whatever it was, please know that you failed. Did you want us to respect your cause? You just damned your cause. Did you want to make us fear? You just steeled our resolve. Did you want to tear us apart? You just brought us together. Let me tell you about my people. We are a vast and quarrelsome family, a family rent by racial, social, political and class division, but a family nonetheless. We re frivolous, yes, capable of expending tremendous emotional energy on pop cultural minutiae -- a singer s revealing dress, a ball team s misfortune, a cartoon mouse. We re wealthy, too, spoiled by the ready availability of trinkets and material goods, and maybe because of that, we walk through life with a certain sense of blithe entitlement. We are fundamentally decent, though -- peace-loving and compassionate. We struggle to know the right thing and to do it. And we are, the overwhelming majority of us, people of faith, believers in a just and loving God. Some people -- you, perhaps -- think that any or all of this makes us weak. You re mistaken. We are not weak. Indeed, we are strong in ways that cannot be measured by arsenals. IN PAIN Yes, we re in pain now. We are in mourning and we are in shock. We re still grappling with the unreality of the awful thing you did, still working to make ourselves understand that this isn t a special effect from some Hollywood blockbuster, isn t the plot development from a Tom Clancy novel. Both in terms of the awful scope of their ambition and the probable final death toll, your attacks are likely to go down as the worst acts of terrorism in the history of the United Statesand, probably, the history of the world. You ve bloodied us as we have never been bloodied before. But there s a gulf of difference between making us bloody and making us fall. This is the lesson Japan was taught to its bitter sorrow the last time anyone hit us this hard, the last time anyone brought us such abrupt and monumental pain. When roused, we are righteous in our outrage, terrible in our force. When provoked by this level of barbarism, we will bear any suffering, pay any cost, go to any length, in the pursuit of justice. I tell you this without fear of contradiction. I know my people, as you, I think, do not. What I know reassures me. It also causes me to tremble with dread of the future. In the days to come, there will be recrimination and accusation, fingers pointing to determine whose failure allowed this to happen and what can be done to prevent it from happening again. There will be heightened security, misguided talk of revoking basic freedoms. We ll go forward from this moment sobered, chastened, sad. But determined, too. Unimaginably determined. THE STEEL IN US You see, the steel in us is not always readily apparent. That aspect of our character is seldom understood by people who don t know us well. On this day, the family s bickering is put on hold. As Americans we will weep, as Americans we will mourn, and as Americans, we will rise in defense of all that we cherish. So I ask again: What was it you hoped to teach us? It occurs to me that maybe you just wanted us to know the depths of your hatred. If that s the case, consider the message received. And take this message in exchange: You don t know my people. You don t know what we re capable of. You don t know what you just started. But you re about to learn.Sabrina PykeAWC, IncorporatedIntegrated Supply Division(713) 944-2100sabrina.pyke@awc-inc.com"

DASRs for these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract execution timing.Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In addition, returning to Utility service may incur a "re-entry fee".Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the Negative CTC credit).We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in number to follow).

When wehaveconsidered central banks or government agencies for membership in the past,consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant s derivativesactivities, its regulatory role and the type of information they are likelyto obtain from ISDA. Because of their derivatives activities, we havegenerally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmarkand Sweden, the Reserve Banks of South Africa and New Zealand). We haveevenadmitted the Bank for International Settlements as a member. In general, welet them know that they may not be able to receive the full range of ISDAmaterials (e.g., draft comment letters or position papers) and that theremay be a need to exclude them from certain committees or discussions.In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has beenexpressedif, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank ofEngland or similarly influential central banks were to apply formembership.These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in theregulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned toinfluence the process.Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank ofEngland has diminished and the role of the Financial Services Authority hascorrespondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditionalcentral bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the marketand lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.In light of these developments, but recognizing the concerns previouslyexpressed on central bank membership, I would appreciate your views on theapplication of the Bank of England. We have also had overtures from theHongKong Monetary Authority regarding membership although we have not receivedan application.Please share your views with the other members of the Board.Bob------------------------------------------------------------------------For more information about Barclays Capital, pleasevisit our web site at http://www.barcap.com.Internet communications are not secure and therefore the BarclaysGroup does not accept legal responsibility for the contents of thismessage.

I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement ("Master") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.  (1)	Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master? Should they be agent for this deal?(2)	Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!)(3)	Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out? There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.  This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.(4)	Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?(5)	Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?  You don t want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.  Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is "related to the Loan Agreement" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.  Is it?(6)	Defining an "event" as either an "Event of Default" or a "Termination Event" has different settlement consequences.  It looks like you re not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is "related" to the Loan Agreement. I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as:"Additional Termination Event will apply.  The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) .  For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty."This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.  Or do you want to calculate at mid?(6)	You should delete Par. 2(a).  I don t believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).  Your lawyer should review the impact of stating "This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement."(7)	Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?(8)	What Transaction(s) are being superseded?  Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained?-----Original Message-----From: Schroeder, Maggie Sent: Tuesday, October 09, 2001 9:37 AMTo: Jesse III, John; Shackleton, Sara; Dobin, NoraSubject: FW: Revised ConfirmJohn, FYINora, If you could review the other provisions to make sure that they picked up our changes.Sara, Could you please give a general review?

It all starts with consumer confidence on Tuesday and ends with the Octo=ber jobs report on Friday. But USD saw more than a little profit taking in =the European session on Monday as traders squared positions ahead of the st=orm.  EUR/USD rose to a one-week high of 89.92, just lacking the momentum t=o get it over the 92-cent mark. The other European majors rose in tandem, c=limbing to respective one-week highs of $1.4479 against the pound and 1.641=1 Swiss francs to the dollar. Sterling also benefited from speculation of M=&A-related inflows. News that U.S. finance house Babcock & Brown may bid fo=r British rail network operator Railtrack and a weekend newspaper report th=at German media giant Bertelsmann was eyeing Britain s Carlton Communicatio=ns added to sterling s appeal, after better than expected GDP data last wee=k. But more surprisingly was the yen s resilience in the face of a further =downgrade by the Bank of Japan and their decision to not try and help the e=conomy with more easy monetary policy. USD/JPY fell to a session low of 122=.13, but regained key support around 122.25 later in the European session. = Given the past two week s of optimism in the face of weak earnings reports=, US economic data this week will give a better clue as to how severe the d=ownturn will be. Most forecasts are expected to show sharp declines and con=firm the US edged closer to recession after the September 11 attacks on the= United States. Final October releases include the Conference Board s confi=dence survey, Chicago PMI, NAPM, the Labor report, this week s jobless clai=ms and the key Q3 GDP preliminary report. This will be the most widely watc=hed release because if the Q3 GDP figure proves to be worse than the negati=ve 0.9% expected, it will have a doubly harsh effect on USD as traders also= anticipate a larger decline in the October Labor report.   In contrast, ha=lf the Eurozone nations will be on holiday this Thursday, which will lead t=o thin markets and high volatility with the bulk of US data due on Wednesda=y and Thursday. Therefore, downside risks to USD are enhanced, with only UK= and Eurozone PMI data to weigh on the euro and pound this week. Comments f=rom ECB member and Bundesbank president Welteke echoed the ECB s recent ass=essment by saying the central bank would  cut rates if it could do so witho=ut hurting price stability. Welteke also saw Eurozone economic growth signi=ficantly below potential at the present and that a return to long term grow=th of 2.5% will be delayed. But, expansionary effects of this years interes=t rate cuts are still in pipeline, he said.  Meanwhile, Q3 company earnings= reports will continue to play an important role in this week s US stock ma=rket and therefore the dollar. So far, over 3/4 of the companies reporting =matched or exceeded projected earnings targets, albeit for drastically lowe=r forecasts. A majority of companies are reporting after the bell and given= this week s upcoming data, trade is likely to be thin ahead going into Wed=nesday. Both Dow and Nasdaq futures are in negative territory.  Today s ble=ak economic and inflation outlook in Japan also failed to spur investors to= go long the dollar against the yen. USD  was unable to benefit from the Ba=nk of Japan s decision to keep monetary policy unchanged despite their fore=cast of a deteriorating economy and rising deflationary concerns. The BoJ s= decision to hold interest rates near zero (ZIRP) and maintain a floor of 6= trillion yen in reserves did not impress FX markets.   But inaction was ex=pected and offers to sell USD above 122.50 capped any dollar gains. Dealers= say failure to extend gains beyond 123 level indicates that a minor top ha=s been formed around last week s two-month high of 123.35. USD/JPY support =seen at 122.30/40, and a break of 122.25/30 opens the way for a breach of t=he key 122.00 level, from which point most traders based their new long pos=itions and where stop loss orders are likely to be placed. USD/JPY now hove=ring around 122.30.  The BoJ also offered a sharp downward revision in its =own economic growth and price outlooks for fiscal 2001 and 2002, saying the= economy was in a "severe" adjustment phase. The Bank expects a further fal=l in exports and output to affect domestic demand in the second half of thi=s fiscal year and not reach a bottom until the second half of FY02/03. Afte=r that, the bank expects exports to recover, but sees prices on continued, =gradual declining trend in FY01/02, and FY02/03. The BoJ board s full outlo=ok for FY01/02 GDP ranged from -1.6% to -0.6%. FY01/02 CPI ranged from -1.3=% to -0.9%. However, the bank s own figures are not seen as making any diff=erence in monetary policy because BoJ Governor Hayami sees structural refor=m as the key to growth, not more money.  In other news, Finance Minister Sh=iokawa said the government will still aim for the 30 trillion JGB cap, but =should remain flexible to unforeseen changes in economic environment. But w=orrying markets is what those "unforeseen changes" might be. If that includ=es today s downward revision to growth and inflation, then markets will be =very disappointed with the new Koizumi government s promise of reform. Any =violation of this key reform is likely to push the yen lower.  Shiokawa als=o said standards should be set for banks to foreclose on borrowers with exc=essive debts. "There are companies that are borrowing from banks that haven= t paid any dividends to shareholders for some years, whose debts have been= forgiven, but are still unable to recover. Banks should be able to foreclo=se on such firms," he said. "There should be a set of standards that makes =it easier for banks to do so. That would be one way of resolving bad loans.=" The Financial Services Agency has been leading efforts to resolve the mas=sive bad loans at banks as part of the government s plans to restructure th=e country s financial system but so far has made little headway.  =09[IMAGE=] Audio Mkt.

Scan Risk is determined by netting the outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Note the outright margin level required for the March 2001 contract, and all subsequent contracts differ.  Spreading between differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the legs of a spread are margined differently.Example at Clearing Member RatesA spread consisting of one leg in the March 2001 contract and another in the April 2001 contract (or any subsequent month) will have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $45,500 starting on Wednesday, March 14, 2001.One Long March 2001 PA   (1 * $50,000) =    $50,000One Short April 2001 PA   (1 * $5,000) =   -$5,000Net Scan Risk    ($50,000-$5,000)=    $45,000Spread Rate    (1* $500) =   +$500Total Requirement            =    $45,500Summary of NYMEX Division Margins on Palladium Futures SpreadsAll Spreads With One Leg in the March 2001 ContractClearing Member (Maintenance Margin): $45,500Member Customer (Initial Margin): $50,050Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin): $61,425Spreads Between All Contract Months Subsequent To the March 2001 ContractClearing Member (Maintenance Margin): $ 300Member Customer (Initial Margin): $ 330Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin): $ 405Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.

Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.Here s some individual comments:Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to "help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he ll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying "show me" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we ve been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it s energy system into the new century...that by opening it s markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it s in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda s comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said "FERC--just get it done"....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn t feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the "there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you ve been talking for 7 years and never could agree..."Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.

My only concern is that we should really try to go for a much shorter time period for Oregon.  I would think about 6 months.  After all, that is NWN s attraction.  Our goal should be to reach CLOSING in 9 months.  Paul, can you talk to Mark and make sure that Sue Ackerman is on board?  Thanks. -----Original Message-----From: 	Kaufman, Paul  Sent:	Monday, October 08, 2001 6:38 PMTo:	Metts, Mark; Uhl, Jessica; Mordaunt, Kristina; Shapiro, RichardSubject:	updateThree matters:1.	Conference call with Staff.Particpants were:  Phil Nyegaard (staff lead for the Enron/PGE merger and currently acting chief of staff); Bryan Conway (lead staff electric techie and staff on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Mark Helman (Staff lead on PGE s rate case and the lead on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Lee Sparling (a lead on a number of gas company cases); and Bonnie Tatum (lead staff gas techie).  The call went well.  Staff was upbeat, interested, but (of course) non-commital.  They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling.  	Timing.  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order.  Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months.  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame.  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker, but this transaction presented different issues than past cases.  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs. electric practices.	Financing.  Helman asked how NNG will finance the ($1.55 billion) cash portion of the purchse.   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB/Merrill financing.  	Other Regulatory Review.  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company.  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt, intrastate.  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction.  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review, but that we expected the issues to be limited.  	Process.  Nyegaard noted that Mark D. and Peggy F. had met with the Commissioners.  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary.  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process.  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details.  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission (after our application is filed).  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction.   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners (!!!!).  We said that we weren t planning any addition private meetings.  2.	Other parties	Sue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday.  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call.  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for today s article.  He questioned NNG s ability to finance the purchase of a larger company.  In his private discussion with Sue, Jenks repeated his concern with NNG s ability to finance the transaction.  The only other concern he raised was NNG s practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature.  	We were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively.3.	Rate Conditions.	We re still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition.  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNG s ROE earnings test.   Under this approach, PGE would:  (1) compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings; (2) create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized; (3) share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points.  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case.	Under this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze.  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however, note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history.  Fuel savings (resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities) would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNG s PGA and through PGE s PCA (of its progeny).  	PGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings.  We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG.  4.	FERC Review	We re pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRA s market power analysis.  A revised schedule for the FERC, SEC, OPUC and WUTC proceedings will be circulated by mid-week.  --end--"

The combination would create a standardizedwholesale market structure called the Standard Market Design for wholesaleelectricity markets ("Standard Market Design").ISO New England, ALSTOM ESCA and PJM, acting through its wholly-ownedsubsidiary, PJM Technologies Inc., have agreed to proceed with thenegotiation of an agreement where ISO New England will purchase the existingPJM market design and certain software components from ALSTOM ESCA and PJM.The two ISOs and ALSTOM ESCA will work together to create a standardizedmarket design that includes solutions to reserve markets and a commonsolution to unit dispatch."This new market standard should put into place the necessary marketimprovements more quickly and at a reduced cost than if we were to implementa customized market system for New England," said William W. Berry, Chairmanand Acting CEO of ISO New England.  "Now is the time to stop theexperimentation.  Ultimately, we hope the Standard Market Design will serveas the benchmark for wholesale electricity marketplaces across the country,if not around the world.""PJM is very excited to further standardize a design for a competitivewholesale electricity market," said Phillip G. Harris, Chairman and CEO ofPJM. "Along with the progress in the implementation of the PJM West concept,this initiative will provide an even broader standardized market design."This approach should further expedite the elimination of trading barriersacross different markets and promote FERC s goal of creating a seamlessmarketplace.  "We intend to continue to work with the New York ISO on issuesof mutual importance," stated Mr. Berry.  "This new market design, togetherwith our efforts to address the market "seams" and other coordinationissues, will eventually bring the three northeast ISO markets closertogether."  ISO New England and the New York ISO will continue to worktogether on these issues under a joint board resolution passed on January16, 2001."Because of our geographic location, New York is in the center of theNortheast markets, with ISO New England, PJM and IMO each on one of ourborders.  We support the continued elimination of barriers across Northeasttrading markets to develop a more seamless marketplace where everyone willbenefit," said William J. Museler, President and CEO of the New YorkIndependent System Operator. "The New York ISO will continue to work withour neighboring markets to remove barriers to trading across the region andto move towards larger regional markets."This proposed market design standard will be developed jointly withstakeholder input. ISO New England will propose the Standard Market Designto the New England Conference of Public Utility Commissioners and the NewEngland Power Pool in a series of meetings next week.  Additional meetingswill be conducted in the next few weeks. The Standard Market Design for NewEngland will be subject to FERC approval."Standardization requires consistent and reliable technology to facilitate amarket s efficiency.  A market that moderates price fluctuations andencourages investment based on an expected return is an efficient market --and efficiency is the key to establishing market liquidity," said AlainSteven, CEO of ALSTOM ESCA.  "In the future, this agreement will be viewedas a catalyst in establishing more robust electricity markets."ISO New England Inc. is the not-for-profit corporation responsible for theday-to-day reliable operation of New England s bulk generation andtransmission systems with an installed capacity of almost 26,000 megawatts.In addition to operating the bulk power grid, ISO New England is theadministrator of the region s wholesale electricity marketplace and the OpenAccess Transmission Tariff on behalf of the New England Power Pool. ISO NewEngland is based in Holyoke, Massachusetts.The PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., is an Independent System Operator,administering the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff and operating the PJMEnergy Markets and Capacity Markets. PJM currently administers the largestwholesale electricity market in the world and has a membership of more than200. It is headquartered in Norristown, Pennsylvania. PJM Technologies, Inc.is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C., designed torespond to market opportunities by bringing cost-effective, reliablesolutions to the energy marketplace. It was created to commercialize PJM sknowledge capital, experience, and proven success in electric energymarkets, system operations, and applications development.# # #For more information about the New York ISO, please call: Steve Sullivan,Director of Communications, 518-356-7605."

For a trading company such asEnron, that is importing products made by other companies, there is not muchadvantage to being importer of record.  The one legal advantage is that theimporter of record can challenge actions taken by the US Customs Service,such as misclassification or valuation issues.   There do not appear to beother legal rights that Enron would sacrifice by not being importer ofrecord.  However, the issue may not be whether Enron should be the importer ofrecord, but whether it can avoid being importer of record.  Particularly intoday s steel market, other parties may not be willing to be importer ofrecord for exactly the reason Stelco indicated -- no one wants to exposethemselves to the possibility of antidumping duties.   Thus, although Enroncould structure a deal in which, for example, Stelco sold to Enron Canada,and Enron sold the steel to a US customer, with that customer acting asimporter of record, with the possibility of a o201 investigation and/orAD/CVD cases lurking on the horizon, the customer may not be willing toexpose itself to the possibility of future AD/CVD duties, and hence would beunwilling to act as importer of record.    If Enron can find someone else who is willing to act as importer of record,you would protect yourself better by structuring the deal that way.   Thequestion is whether you can find someone to be importer of record.Feel free to call if you have any questions.Regards,Betsy NOTICE: This communication may contain privileged or other confidentialinformation.

Before I do so, do you have any objections?  I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the "new sector weighted voting model" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility.  However, I don t know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot.  Thoughts?AndyGordon,When did the ESC vote to adopt the  "new sector weighted voting model?"  Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model?  If so, is the ESC a new standing committee?  Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC?Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don t see how this can move forward as written.  The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation, meeting schedules, etc...).  If I recall correctly, there was a significant number of people that specifically did not _want_ the ESC to be a NERC group, (APPA, ELCON, EPSA, and a few others, if I remember correctly).  This was why the NERC ESTF became the non-NERC ESC.  I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC.  Of course, those comments may have already been made at the Board, and may have been addressed there.  But I seriously don t think NERC can just "annex" the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed.

Attached is a copy of  her ruling.  Her primary rationale is expressed on page 6, as  follows:".....the Commission has frequently  deviated from cost allocations based solely on LRMC, and has been moving  towards embedded costs for unbundled transmission and storage functions, as  evidenced in both the recent decision in the GIR, and in the Gas Accord for  PG&E.  Therefore, it is  apparent that the Commission is interested in comparing LRMC and embedded cost  for cost allocation purposes.  For  this reason, EGA s motion to strike testimony on embedded cost-based  allocation is denied.  Testimony  on embedded costs will be compared with the testimony on LRMC, to enable  parties and the Commission to determine which method, or combination of  methods, is most appropriate for allocation among customers of each utilities   non-gas costs of service.   Including an embedded cost analysis in this BCAP might require more  work from all the parties, but the record will then be as complete as possible  so that the Commission can make a well-informed  decision."She also ruled that, "The  evidentiary hearing schedule of May 21 through June 14, 2002, is not suspended  at this time.  No later than January  22, 2002, parties are to meet and confer to determine if a shift in the filing  dates for testimony will be sufficient to meet the needs of the parties  to  respond to the March amendments to Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding  applications, and keep the established hearing schedule."Dan Law Offices of Daniel W.

This issue surfaced when I told Carla that all of the firm takeaway (receipt point) capacity had already been taken.The point here is that we might have shippers (successfully) using alt. receipt rights under existing contracts at discounted rates to receive firm gas off PNM.

American Gas TeamE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: North American Gas ,URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1415 ,Alternative URL: http://www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/111000_11/nag_alt_111000_11_ab.htmlCold weather in the Midwest and reduced storageinjections have taken up much of the temporary slackthat developed in the gas market during the warmOctober. As expected, prices have responded quickly tothe cold, with the December futures contract priceadvancing by over $0.75 per million British thermalunits (MMBtu) in the past week. As cold weatherdevelops, late winter supply availability is stilluncertain in CERA s view. For that reason, dual-fuelmarkets must remain off of gas, and market fundamentalssupport the recent price rebound, which places gasprices again at a premium to resid.CERA estimates that US working storage inventories as ofthe end of October were approximately 2,746 billioncubic feet (Bcf), an all-time low for that date by 64Bcf (see table below). Storage injections of 36 Bcf forthe week ending November 3 were higher than a normalweather pattern would indicate, but more normal weatherfor the remainder of the month would result inwithdrawals averaging 3.5 Bcf per day during November.This withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standardsbut 2.5 Bcf per day higher than occurred in the past twoyears (see table below). This pace of withdrawals placesinventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of771 Bcf under normal winter weather conditions, only 13Bcf above the previous all-time low.This market remains tight. Although added supplies willbegin to help by the end of the winter, for now somedemand must still be priced out of the market in orderto preserve storage inventories.**end**Follow URL for HTML version of this message only.**********************************************************************Account ChangesTo edit your personal account information, including your e-mailaddress, etc. go to: http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfmThis electronic message and attachments, if any, contain informationfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

This probably tellsus that we need to leave enough time between the last scraping  and the cube processing, although what caused the blow-up yesterday is still mysterious. The lesson is when it is working, do not make changes, or it may break.  There are still a  few format issues I need to fix.Yan  -----Original Message-----From: 	Wang, Yan  Sent:	Monday, April 30, 2001 10:37 AMTo:	Gaskill, Chris; Reitmeyer, Jay; Smith, Matt; Piazze, Tara; Tonks, Colin; Hyde, Chris; Dronet, David; Zhang, EddieCc:	Alexander, Kim D; Hylton, Angela; Chiu, LindonSubject:	issue with report generation issueAll:As you all noticed that on many of our morning reports today "NA" were put there as today s data,that means at the time those reports were generated today s data were not in the cube, so the reportengine put "NA" there. However, by looking at the Retrieved_DTM field in the Meter_Usage_Stattable in our database it showed that the scrapings were successful for all west pipelines as of 11 PM last night. When I checked the history log of cube processing, the cube were processed  successfully both times at 11:59 PM last night and 6:30 AM this morning, respectively.We process cube twice in the morning, the purpose of second processing is to grab those manual entry data.Reports generated after second processing (CIG_WIC, SoCal, and Rockies Production) were all successful.Only those reports generated after first processing are problematic. So only two possibilities I can thick of canexplain this: 1) Although processing log showed success, it did not actually grab newly entered data to the cube with the first procssing. 2) Those data were not in the database table at the time of first processing.I believe the true reason has to be one of the above. But my investigation so far can not give me any clue as whatcould have caused one of above. Because if 1) was true, we ll need ask Microsoft on the consistency of cube processing,cube processing has never failed us before. If 2) was true, it could not explain why in the Retrieved_DTM column ofMeter_Usage_Stat table showed us that before the first processing the data were already in the database.My intention to move the first processing time from 2:30 AM to 11:59 PM was to have more time between the two processing to take care of the growing number of reports we are generating. I thought 1 hour difference between the last scraping and cube processing should be enough. That was the only change I made last week and we had not experience such a problem before this change. So without knowing the true cause of the problem, what I am going to do is to move the 1st cube processingtime back to 2:30 AM to see if it corrects the problem. I ll try to be here early tomorrow morning to make sure all the reports run fine.I welcome your suggestions and comments on the possible cause of the problem to suggestions on how to prevent this fromhappening again.ThanksYan x33228"

I would prefer to have it used by the analysts at least for a few days to iron out any more potential "bugs" before releasing it to users on the floor.  If the consensus is to have people on the floor be the testers, that is fine as well, as long as they know that the following URL points to a development server.Without further ado, the link to the Manual Entry Page:http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/As stated in the above URL, this is located on the DEVELOPMENT web server.  Users should honestly never be directed to this URL, unless authorized by one of the site developers, since anything on it is subject to be currently in development (read: potentially broken).Anyway, here are some things that have been added to the Manual Entry piece in this release:"Previous" data now reflects information in the DB for the latest effective date for the selected cycle (not just "Yesterday" as before)...There is now an option to enter data for a "special cycle 0"...this is to be used on occasions where no data was scraped (for whatever reason), but there is some available that can be manually entered.  Selecting this option causes ALL points for a given pipeline to be displayed (both normally scraped points AND manually entered points).  A cycle of  0  is applied to this data, and it should only show up on reports until valid scrape data becomes available (since the report engine is designed to pull the latest cycle available).You can now add "extra" line items to be stored in the DB...this is to be used when you must enter data for more than one flow type for a given point (i.e. the point is reported as both a Receipt and a Delivery).  This should normally only have to be done the first time data is entered for that pipe, since the "Previous" data will handle pulling in and displaying (the next time) every flow type stored for every point on the pipe.NOTE:  It is set to only allow 1 extra point to be added...this was done to simplify the handling of this feature; I m open to discussion if you feel there is a need to enter more than one extra point (I see it as a Receipt/Delivery issue...will a point ever be more than that?  Receipt/Delivery/Storage or something?)I have also fixed the "Exceptions Occurred" bug that cropped up recently...this was caused by moving the manually entered points to their own unique pipeline ids.  The Jaguar system did not get updated to account for that, but it is updated now.Aside from the above, minor tweaks here and there have also been made.  I am going to enlist the aid of Junellen to "beautify" the layout, but provided no more bugs appear during testing this should be good to go into production by the beginning of next week.Any questions, feel free to ask or reply.Thanks,Chris"

Due to "scheduling conflicts," Wagner pushed back the deadline for president ALJ Jacob Leventhal to issue a decision to Oct. 30 from Oct. 15. FERC ordered the hearing in late July to determine whether Transwestern exercised market power in arranging negotiated-rate contracts for capacity that led to some shippers being charged up to $27/MMBtu in February, which the Commission estimated was "70 times the recourse rate.""

There is no forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched more. 2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural gas prices back to 1993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them make a better case with their customer. 3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina.4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions at the plant. 5) Mariella Mahan s group called looking for help on physical and financial resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves.6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new product to be offered to Conoco.7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them operate. 8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge tied to crude. 9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project. 10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped Enron s case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking for. All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM. Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems. If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it."

The treasurer is certain the bonds will be sold, but he released the figures in an attempt to pressure the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) into actions it must take in order to sell the bonds. "What I am concerned about is the fact this law has not been effectuated eight months after it was passed," Angelides said in a telephone news conference in Sacramento, referring to a law passed in February setting the biggest municipal bond sale ever in motion. The state depleted its general fund by at least $6.2 billion buying electricity to keep power flowing and must sell the bonds in order to refill the state s general fund and make future power purchases. "There can be no schedule (for the bond sale) until the PUC completes its work," Angelides said. Earlier this week the PUC said the much-delayed meeting is now set for Oct. 2. Angelides said PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown, one of five, is on board to make the vote, but President Loretta Lynch and other commissioners, "are not ready to act." Lynch said earlier this week that she wants more time to work out details with Angelides and the Department of Water Resources concerning the money and terms of the rate order and rate agreement. How the money from rate increases approved in May will be split up to pay for the bonds and to reimburse troubled power utilities and giving the Department of Water Resources the authority to sell the bonds, still need to be decided by the PUC. Angelides is projecting a $3.1 billion budget deficit for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, even if the bonds are sold in time, due to reduced revenues as the overall U.S. economy slows. In a worst case scenario, Angelides added that with the bond sale, the $3.1 billion gap may grow to $4 billion, while a late sale would push the $9.3 billion number to $10.2 billion. The treasurer painted a dire picture of California  s budget if the bonds are not sold, likening it to the state s budget problems of the early 1990s. Angelides warned a 2 percent sales tax increase might have to be put in place, or possibly a $1,574 per student cut in state K-12 education spending. Or, the state could drop all spending on the University of California and California State University and save $6 billion. Eighteen percent of the state s non-education budget would need to be cut if the bonds are not sold, he said. **********************************************************************This e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient (s).

(PR); Mellencamp, Lisa; Sharp, VickiSubject:	California Update--08.09.01THE LEGISLATURENo material change from the last update.  The Legislature is in recess and the two bills that passed the Senate--SB 78 and SB 18--continue to sit in the Assembly, waiting for the Assembly to return on August 20th.Support for the two bills in Assembly is currently very weak.A handful of Democratic Assembly legislators and staff have been meeting over the recess to determine whether they can 1) reach agreement on the bill that the Assembly s been working on (AB 82), and 2) reach agreement with the Democrats in the Senate.We will distribute the output of those meetings as soon as it is available.The key features of SB 78 would: allow Edison to recover $2.5 of the $3.5 B of payables. earmark the $2.5 B to pay the banks and the QFs.  leave Edison to figure out how to cover the remaining $1B in payables to suppliers (including Enron).single out the largest business customers to pay for 100% of the $2.5 B in payables.give the State the option to buy Edison s transmission assets at book.do nothing to ensure Direct Access is maintained.The key features of AB 82 would:maintain a week form of Direct Access, though the bill doesn t go nearly far enough with respect to DA.adopt some of SB 78 s the onerous features (e.g., no authorization to pay back suppliers; force the biggest business customers to pay down Edison s debt to the banks and QFs).The key features of SB 18 would:restructure the way in which the upcoming bond issuance is financed by creating a "dedicated utility rate component" (i.e., a fixed charge) to service the bonds.de-link payments to suppliers holding DWR contracts from payments to service the bonds to pay back the General Fund.allow the PUC to hold a public hearing on DWR s contracts.A consortium of small and large businesses and business associations sent a strongly worded letter today to Davis and all members of the CA Legislature expressing extreme opposition to both 78 and 82.  I have a copy of the letter and will distribute to anyone who would like to see it.In the same letter, the business consortium strongly supports SB 18 because they fear they will get stuck with any out-of-the-money DWR contracts.The consortium is lobbying hard to have the DWR contracts nullified or re-negotiated.The Treasurer and the Governor oppose SB 18 because they believe 1) it would constitute contract breach, and 2) the contract provisions require the state to pay the present value of the contract plus LD in the event of a breach.Calpine, who holds about 50% of the DWR contract volume, is also opposed to SB 18.Opposition to any form of "Edison bailout" is increasing among policy makers, opinion leaders and the pressThere is currently a 50-50 or better chance that the Legislature will NOT pass an Edison MOU before the session ends, though that could change.THE CALIFORNIA PUCSince the legislature has failed to pass comprehensive legislation addressing CA s crisis, the issues now revert back to the PUC.In particular, the PUC is slated to rule on August 23rd on whether Direct Access should be suspended.The Treasurer has said that DA must be suspended in order to remove any risk that DA might create with respect to impairing the revenue stream necessary to service the bonds.AB 1X, the law that authorized DWR to buy power, gives the PUC the authority to suspend Direct Access.Enron is leading a large group of customers and suppliers in an effort to stop the PUC from suspending Direct Access.The group is writing a letter to Davis, the PUC, the Treasurer, DWR and the Legislature urging them to maintain Direct Access.That letter should be released Friday or Monday.The group is also making a submission to the PUC as early as Monday to provide the Commission with practical alternatives that would permit the the PUC to maintain Direct Access.The group is also mounting a PR campaign that it wil launch simultaneously with the release of the letter and the submission to the PUC.Currently, the chances that the PUC will suspend Direct Access on the 23rd is better than 50 percent, but a considerable effort is underway to reverse the situation.If you have any questions, don t hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

CPUC doesn t like that logic, although if bankruptcy happens its about the same effect?as?imposing that obligation on DWR.?

Since that time, the ISO has discovered that it has capacity substantially in excess of what it needs to operate the grid (and certain markets for power, e.g., ancillary services).  Rather than try to re-negotiate the contract with MCI, the ISO is now looking at marketing the capacity.

Rose= =20UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 31, 2001  San Diego Gas & Electric yesterd=ay=20denied allegations that it systematically lied about the debt it racked up==20during the power crisis, despite revelations that the company earned hundre=ds=20of millions from some power sales.  SDG&E and its parent company, Sempra=20Energy, acknowledged making profits from selling electricity but insisted==20those gains have no bearing on the $750 million debt the utility claims to =be=20owed by customers for power purchases during the energy crisis.  "Those are==20completely separate transactions," said Ed Van Herik, a spokesman for SDG&E=.=20The company s effort to seal a deal with the state to clear the $750 millio=n=20debt has come under attack by the Utility Consumers  Action Network. The Sa=n=20Diego-based consumer group says SDG&E s claimed debt is the result of=20selective bookkeeping, bordering on fraud.  The bottom line, says UCAN, is==20that SDG&E engaged in deception and probably owes its customers money. =20SDG&E, which claimed to have sold customers electricity without markups,=20actually "was buying electricity at a low price and selling it at a higher==20price to us," said Shames. "SDG&E customers have been systematically lied t=o=20over the past year about this balancing account."  UCAN says that SDG&E=20earned an estimated $450 million from its power sales to the state, while==20publicly declaring that it was posting only losses from buying power.  Sham=es=20said much of the information leading to UCAN s conclusion came from a=20detailed analysis of documents made available in recent weeks.  The state==20Office of Ratepayer Advocates, meanwhile, yesterday said a new filing by=20SDG&E that claims its power-sales profits belong to stockholders, not=20consumers, is "specious" and "without merit."  Van Herik insisted the compa=ny=20had not been misleading. The spokesman noted that the company earlier was==20required to buy electricity from the Power Exchange, a now-defunct=20marketplace established by the state as part of its deregulation plan.  "Wh=at=20we said is that we were buying electricity for our customers and passing=20along the cost without markup," said Van Herik.  What SDG&E failed to=20publicly announce was that it was simultaneously selling electricity to the==20Power Exchange for an apparently healthy profit.  Under certain contracts,==20SDG&E had locked in electricity at prices substantially below going rates==20during the ongoing power crisis. The company declined yesterday to reveal==20terms of the contracts. But UCAN estimates the contracts provided electrici=ty=20to the utility at no more than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  SDG&E then sold==20that relatively cheap power to the Power Exchange for a higher price and=20pocketed the profit, which it also declined to disclose.  As it profited fr=om=20the power sales, SDG&E bought power at higher prices from the exchange and==20billed customers for what it paid.  Whenever SDG&E s costs to buy electrici=ty=20exceeded what state regulators would allow the utility to charge customers,==20it recorded the amounts in balancing accounts. That account grew to $750=20million.  But SDG&E never offset its losses from electricity purchases with==20its profit from sales.  Van Herik said the practice was appropriate because==20the lucrative contracts for cheap power were owned by the company s=20shareholders, not its customers. The practice of keeping profits and losses==20entirely separate, he said, was endorsed by a California Public Utilities==20Commission audit.  But the first formal ruling on that matter came in June,==20when the full commission ruled that all profits from SDG&E s contractual=20power deals belong to its customers.  SDG&E went to court to overturn the==20commission s ruling, but put the legal effort on hold shortly before Sempra==20reached a tentative agreement with the state to clear the $750 million debt=.=20The proposal with the state would reverse the utilities commission ruling a=nd=20award the company s shareholders ownership of the profits SDG&E made from==20selling power.  Van Herik said yesterday that the state made the concession==20because it recognized that SDG&E had a strong legal case.  But Shames says==20the state had a strong case and noted that the Office of Ratepayer Advocate=s=20agreed. He is asking the utilities commission to reject the deal.  State Se=n.=20Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said he believes that consumer objections to the==20balancing account deal are aimed at getting ratepayers a better deal -- and==20that s something he supports.  "If Michael Shames can improve on the=20balancing account deal I m in full support as long as we don t lose any of==20the gains we ve already gotten," he said.  A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis==20did not return a telephone call seeking reaction to the UCAN allegations. ==20Outside UCAN s office in Little Italy yesterday, a group of trade unionists==20demonstrated in support of SDG&E s position. Dave Moore, a business manager==20for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 465, said SDG=&E=20has handled its power purchases in accordance with utilities commission=20rulings.  But Shames said the company sought to shield its actions from the==20scrutiny of consumer groups and the public.  "They consistently said they==20were not making money from this," said the consumer advocate. "For them to==20split hairs and say,  We didn t make money from purchases, we made it from==20sales,  is disingenuous."

Sempra Energy Resources will file a==20200-page application with the city Planning Department for a 550-megawatt,==20natural gas-fired power plant and roughly 100-acre business park in southwe=st=20Escondido, Sempra spokesman Tom Murnane said.  "It (the application) is ver=y=20detailed," Murnane said. "We have not done an application of this sort=20before. This is the first time Sempra Energy Resources has been involved in==20the development of a business park."  Sempra is building the project in=20partnership with JRM Real Estate, a Carlsbad-based developer.  The Californ=ia=20Energy Commission will have final say on the power plant, which could take==20three to four years to get on line. The City Council will decide on the=20industrial park.  City officials have awaited Sempra s bid ever since the==20idea was broached in January. The project addresses two needs: The power=20plant would provide enough energy to power almost a half-million homes, and==20the business park would bring higher-paying jobs to a city with the lowest==20median income in North County.  "I m awaiting with great anticipation to se=e=20what they have planned," said City Councilwoman June Rady. "I have met with==20Sempra officials several times in the past and what they have shared with m=e=20I ve been very excited about."  Sempra has promised that its proposed plant==20would have lower emission levels than any plant now in the state. The compa=ny=20also has said the plant would not have a tall smokestack, or a visible vapo=r=20plume such as the one produced by the city s Iceoplex generating plant.  Th=e=20plant and park are slated for Quail Hills, the last large parcel of vacant==20industrial land in the city. Several previous plans by other developers hav=e=20failed after they discovered the high costs involved with building on the==20hilly terrain.

Gray Davis  press=20secretary recently purchased the same energy stock as five consultants the==20governor fired last week, he disclosed Monday.  Steve Maviglio confirmed th=at=20on June 20, he bought 300 shares of stock in Calpine Corp., a San Jose-base=d=20power generator that has received about $13 billion in state contracts to==20supply electricity for up to 20 years.  Maviglio s disclosure comes after==20Davis  office hastily ended the contracts of five consultants who helped=20negotiate state power contracts and held stock in energy companies.  In a==20related development, an anonymous source told the Los Angeles Times on Mond=ay=20that the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary=20inquiry into whether the consultants used inside information to trade the==20energy stocks.  About two dozen Davis energy consultants were required to==20fill out financial disclosure statements after complaints of conflict of=20interest by Republicans and consumer groups.  "When we reviewed them, we=20found possible violations of the law and took swift action," Maviglio said==20Monday before Secretary of State Bill Jones issued a press release calling==20for his termination.  Jones, a Republican, is a candidate for the GOP=20nomination to challenge Davis in November 2002.  Maviglio defended his=20purchase, saying that he "owns several stocks in companies in all fields th=at=20are growing and are based in California."  Maviglio said Monday that he=20requested on May 31 to purchase the stock if it dipped to $40 a share, whic=h=20it did two days after a June 18 ruling by federal energy regulators=20restricting wholesale electricity prices in California and 10 other states.= =20Maviglio served as Davis  chief spokesman urging the Federal Energy=20Regulatory Commission to impose price ceilings on electricity wholesalers. ==20He also said he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 stock in Houston-based=20Enron Corp. He said he purchased the stock in 1997 and has reported it on==20financial disclosure forms. He said that it is "closer to $10,000." =20Meanwhile, two energy consultants to Davis have agreed to forgo more than==20$50,000 in work they did for the state.  Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani will==20forgo the payments as part of a settlement with a Sacramento-area resident==20who filed a lawsuit objecting to their hiring, calling it a conflict of=20interest.  Fabiani could not be reached for comment Monday. In the=20settlement, they admitted no wrongdoing.  Lehane issued a statement through==20the governor s office, calling it "simply not worth the bother to challenge==20the controller in court."  Davis has come under fire for his May hiring of==20Lehane, former press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, and Fabiani, a==20deputy campaign manager for Gore s presidential run.  They were hired to he=lp=20shape Davis  response to the energy crisis, and helped craft Davis =20aggressive attack on Texas-based energy companies and President Bush.  Both==20also have advised Southern California Edison, which is negotiating for stat=e=20help in avoiding bankruptcy. Financial disclosure forms showed they have ea=ch=20received at least $10,000 from Edison in the past year.  Davis announced at==20the end of June that Fabiani terminated his contract, and Davis scaled back==20Lehane s role with the state.  State Controller Kathleen Connell then said==20she would not pay Lehane and Fabiani for any of their work and now the two==20have agreed they will not fight her decision, Maviglio said.  Lewis K. Uhle=r,=20the Placer County man who filed the lawsuit, said the settlement=20"accomplished our objectives."  "We wanted to block the egregious use of=20taxpayer funds for essentially political spinmeisters," he said. Uhler is==20president of the Roseville-based National Tax Limitation Committee.  Mavigl=io=20said that Fabiani and Lehane "did good work for the state" and helped the==20state win victories with federal regulators.=20THE STATEDavis  Energy Advisors Draw SEC AttentionProbe: Under review is the possible use of inside information to buy power==20company stocks. GOP rival of governor requested the inquiry.By WALTER HAMILTON JEFFERY L. RABIN and DARYL KELLEYTIMES STAFF WRITERSJuly 31 2001The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a preliminary inquiry==20into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray Davis used inside=20information to trade stocks of power companies doing business with the stat=e,=20a source with knowledge of the matter said Monday.The federal agency began its review late last week, the source said, in=20response to a request from California Secretary of State Bill Jones. A=20Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading by consultants==20may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling based on=20information not available to the public.On Friday, top aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had be=en=20fired for possible conflicts of interest between their official positions a=nd=20their personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the=20capital Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions=20about who in the administration owns energy stocks.Financial disclosure records filed by the governor s spokesman, Steve=20Maviglio, show that he owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company==20he and his boss have accused of making "obscene" profits while California h=as=20been "on its knees." Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based=20Enron Corp. in 1996."It s not a crime to own energy stock," Maviglio said.He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which has the=20largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one day after San Jose s==20mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial Calpine plant favored by th=e=20governor and others. Under the terms of Maviglio s purchase, the transactio=n=20was completed about three weeks later when the stock reached $40 a share, a==20value of $12,000. It has since fallen in value."I viewed it as a good long-term investment," Maviglio said, adding that he==20purchased the shares for his retirement account based on publicly available==20information.The Davis administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms==20that it has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But=20California s grid operator has identified the company as one of many energy==20merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.The fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from==20several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show.Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs secretary Barry=20Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that he recently held==20between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state company accused of==20multimillion-dollar price gouging.In a statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co s. a month afte=r=20he began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were==20supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker=20failed to do so.In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of State Jones said the=20governor must do more to ensure the public that its interest comes first."The governor should direct all of his staff to immediately file updated=20conflict of interest statements that reflect current holdings and any=20activity since their last statement of economic interest was filed," said==20Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for governor.Word of the SEC s entry into California s energy problems comes as the=20governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for the quick and==20broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him through the=20crisis.In his written request to the SEC, Jones said that recently filed disclosur=e=20documents showed that at least one consultant bought and sold shares of two==20energy companies within the same month, raising "a red flag" about the=20possibility of insider trading.State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving the=ir=20personal financial interests.The five consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones  letter,==20delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was not==20clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC s inquiry, or whether the==20agency s review would result in any charges.Two of the former traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by==20federal investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider==20trading.But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery why so many of his==20colleagues owned Calpine stock.Mead said he bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommende=d=20it to his colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the=20now-defunct California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not=20traded on that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.Mead and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and=20March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying pow=er=20for the state from Calpine while owning the company s stock. Fired traders==20Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the date of=20their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state required to =be=20filed only two weeks ago."But I m sure they bought it while they were still at the power exchange,==20because that s when we discussed it," Mead said.

"But it clearly does==20not get them to the level where they are able to emerge from bankruptcy and==20make all of their creditors whole."=20The disclosure by PG&E Corp. yesterday adds a modest boost to its quarterly==20earnings report, set for tomorrow morning. The company is expected to repor=t=20an operating profit of 71 cents per share, according to analysts polled by==20Thomson Financial/First Call, an investment research firm.=20PG&E Corp. is the owner of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which filed for=20Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after electricity prices soared==20this year. The utility had previously estimated that it lost $1.1 billion i=n=20the first quarter and $4.1 billion in the fourth because it was prohibited =by=20the state Public Utilities Commission from passing higher costs on to=20consumers.=20PG&E Corp. also includes a energy producing unit, which generally makes=20money, and a venture capital arm. Neither of those divisions is affected by==20the utility s bankruptcy.=20The utility said it got a small break in March as the price it was paying t=o=20the California Independent System Operator for energy declined sharply. The==20unanticipated drop was attributed to declining demand because of energy=20conservation, low tempera-=20tures and the opening of new power plants in the state.=20The utility also benefited from the cancellation of power contracts by=20companies that did not want to do business with a bankrupt partner. Those==20contracts were for selling power at below cost.=20What is the utility s gain, though, may be a negative for PG&E s power-=20producing division.

GRAY DAVIS seems to have an ethical blind spot when it comes to the=20hiring of outsiders to help manage California s energy crisis.=20Throughout the crisis, Davis has been intolerably slow in responding to=20questions about whether certain members of his inner circle -- drawing big==20checks off the public payroll -- might have possible financial conflicts.==20As of yesterday, the governor s office still has not required 16 contractor=s=20to file public disclosure documents that would reveal whether they have any==20financial stake in companies affected by policies they help develop.=20Steve Maviglio, the governor s press secretary, said 42 energy "consultants="=20have filed their economic disclosure statements. But he said the other 16==20were "contractors" -- without actual decisionmaking authority -- and were==20thus not required to fill out the forms.=20Maviglio s "contractor versus consultant" distinctions are technical and=20semantic. His spin simply doesn t wash.=20The bottom line is that "contractors" who are making big decisions involvin=g=20big dollars for the state are not playing by the same rules as others in th=e=20public trust.=20For example, Davis has exempted two Wall Street executives, Joseph Fichera==20and Michael Hoffman, who are putting together a rescue plan that involves a==20$12.5 billion bond issue. They are getting $275,000 a month for their advic=e.=20Yet they have not been required to fill out disclosure forms, which would==20allow the governor -- and any other Californian -- to assess whether a=20potential conflict exists.=20"They told us they don t have any conflicts," said Maviglio, who,=20incidentally, confirmed yesterday that in June he bought $12,000 worth of==20stock in the Calpine Corp., the generating company with the largest chunk o=f=20state power contracts. On July 2, Davis publicly praised Calpine as "the mo=st=20responsible of the generators."=20Davis should have finally learned his lesson last week after having to fire==20five consultants -- all involved in energy trading -- when their belatedly==20filed disclosure forms showed serious potential conflicts.

The proposed==20public power board would have seven elected directors, but the agency still==20would retain some ties to City Hall.=20The supervisors  plan is intended to be used as a backup to the municipal==20utility district -- commonly known as a MUD -- which is considered to be mo=re=20vulnerable to the expected legal challenges from PG&E.=20"It s a great marriage, and will ensure that we get public power in San=20Francisco," said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, chief sponsor =of=20the board s measure.=20San Francisco is not alone in looking at public power. San Diego, the first==20city to feel the hard pinch of the energy crisis, wants to establish a=20regional public power system in an attempt to pool resources and bring down==20energy costs.=20The East Bay Municipal Utility District, which provides water and sewer=20service, is considering expanding its reach to power. In the Bay Area, the==20cities of Alameda and Palo Alto already have public power. The two largest==20public power agencies in the state serve Los Angeles and Sacramento.=20In San Francisco, the pro-public power forces are going to tout the promise=d=20virtues of turning the electric utility over to a public authority that by==20law cannot turn a profit. That, they contend, means lower rates.=20"It s an expectation, but it s also tried and true," said Ross Mirkarimi,==20campaign director of MUD Now, the group sponsoring the ballot initiative.==20On average, consumers pay 18 percent less for power from public utilities, =he=20said.=20Gallagher, spokesman for the opposition campaign, said ratepayers shouldn t==20assume that public power means lower energy bills. "There s no way the rate=s=20are going down," he said.=20He blamed the energy crisis not on deregulation but on a shortage of=20electricity, which jacked up prices and undercut reliability.=20"The measures do nothing about supply," Gallagher said.

However, what s even more encouraging here is to see that shippers are now validating the message TW embodied in its GIR proposal -- new market entrants should only have secondary rights to SoCal system capacity in instances where there is a capacity shortage.Shippers Dispute Kern s Wheeler Ridge SalesChevron, Amoco Production, CanWest Gas Supply, Aera Energy and RME Petroleum have called on FERC to stop Kern River Gas Transmission from overselling delivery point rights at Wheeler Ridge into the Southern California Gas Co. distribution system. The Firm Shippers said in comments filed this week that, in a situation strangely similar to the recent El Paso capacity reallocation case, Kern River has oversold capacity at Wheeler Ridge, and its proposed expansion project will only exacerbate the situation (Docket CP01-31). On Nov. 15, 2000, Kern filed an application to expand its system and provide 74,500 Dth/d of additional delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge into SoCal Gas. But Firm Shippers claim recent data provided by Kern and SoCal Gas indicates Kern River already has sold more than the 450 MMcf/d of firm delivery point capacity it has available into Wheeler Ridge. Firm Shippers told FERC. Kern River has sold 468.4 MMcf/d of capacity at Wheeler Ridge. Not true, says Lynn Dahlberg, Kern s manager of marketing. "We have to date subscribed at 450,000 dth/d. And unless we subscribe at more than 830,000 dth/d, we have not sold more capacity than SoCal has takeaway." The combined Kern-Mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600,000 dth/d, with Kern having 450,00 and Mojave 150,000. "We can move more than that capacity, and we have," she added. SoCal Gas has noted that it curtails nominations from Kern on a regular basis, Shippers said. With the proposed expansion project, Kern will be "creating the same type of firm delivery point over-sale situation that the Commission found to be unjust and unreasonable on El Paso Natural Gas at El Paso s SoCal Gas/Topock delivery point," they added. While they support the expansion, they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in Southern California degraded. They also complained that Kern s marketing affiliate is one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to Wheeler Ridge. Dahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the Wheeler Ridge point, but "adding more players to Wheeler gives markets on SoCal more supply options. Shippers have to compete." The shippers are concerned, however that "substantial benefits under the currently structured proposal accrue primarily to Kern River and its affiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers...."

216807,jennifer.rudolph@enron.com,ca.team@enron.com,"*  I saw this in yesterday s business sectionPaper: Houston ChronicleDate: SUN 05/13/01Section: BUSINESSPage: 7Edition: 2 STARMontana  s power crisis may be more intense thanCalifornia s By JIM ROBBINSNew York TimesBUTTE, Mont. - The last large-scale metal mine is silent in this city that sits astride the Rocky Mountains. The 170-ton, house-sized ore-hauling trucks, which once rumbled with loads 24 hours a day, have not fired up their engines since last summer. Nor have the conveyors, the crushers, the concentrators and the grinders. And most of the 320 workers who carved out a living extracting copper, molybdenum and silver from the 600-foot deep Continental Pit have scattered to other states and other jobs. Montana Resources, which owns the mine, has been out of affordable power for nine months. At the beginning of 2000, the mine was paying $26 a megawatt hour, up from $19 the year before. Last week, however, a megawatt hour cost $320. While California has grabbed most of the national headlines for a power crisis caused by deregulation gone awry - rolling blackouts resumed there last week - another power deregulation crisis has been unfolding here in Montana . And in some ways, it is far more striking in its impact. While Californians may be somewhat protected from skyrocketing costs, Montanans are not. Paper companies, mines and other large industrial companies in Montana have been laying off workers because they cannot afford to pay their electric bills. Residents are expecting their household electric costs to as much as double by July 2002. A growing number of Montanans want to roll back the clock to a time when their state, blessed with its own sources of cheaply produced power, had some of the lowest electricity rates in the country. Many residents are directing their anger at the Legislature, which in their view deregulated the market for electrical power solely at the behest of the Montana Power Co., once the state s dominant utility. Under deregulation that took effect three years ago, Montana Power sold its hydroelectric and coal-fired generating plants to PPL Corp., the Allentown, Pa., company that sells power in 42 states and in Canada, Great Britain and Latin America. Like other owners of power generation sites, PPL has been profiting immensely under deregulation by charging rates based on the forces of supply and demand. Montana Power still distributes electric power around the state, but soon will be getting out of that business as well. The change has left large power consumers such as Montana Resources scrambling to survive. They have scoured the region for affordable alternatives. They have asked PPL to make at least some cheaper electricity available but it is unclear if that will happen. And they have lobbied the Legislature to reregulate electrical power. "We ve got to play all of our cards," said Greg Stricker, president of Montana Resources, as he gazed over the company s open mining pit and a giant statue of the Virgin Mary that sits high on a mountain above it. "We re faced with extinction." PPL, however, says it has no choice but to sell its power at market prices. On a national scale, the plight of Montana , which has less than a million people, is not as visible as that of California, which has 34 million. But Montana  s experience shows what can happen when power prices spiral out of control and businesses and consumers are not protected. Montana  s power crisis is rooted in the history of the Montana Power Co. It was formed in 1912 by Anaconda Copper Mining to ensure power for Anaconda s extensive mining, milling and sawmill operations. Montana Power built hydroelectric dams on 11 rivers across the state, dams that still create power at low cost. Anaconda also was accustomed to getting its own way. The company owned most of the state s daily newspapers until 1959 and wielded tremendous influence among elected officials. Anaconda, the historian Bernard DeVoto wrote, "maintained a more thorough-going ownership of Montana  s wealth, government and inhabitants than any other corporation has ever been able to maintain in any other state." The Anaconda era ended in 1977 when the company was bought by Atlantic Richfield, the oil company that has since been acquired by BP. Arco closed the mines in 1980 and the smelter in 1983. Montana Power, which had become the state s regulated utility, outlived its creator. By the mid-1990s, however, Montana Power was worrying about its own future. Power deregulation, a national trend, looked inevitable, and the company s big industrial customers already were shopping for sources of cheaper electricity . So, trying to make a virtue of necessity, Montana Power began the process of getting out of the power business. It diversified, creating an Internet service provider called Touch America. It also began to push for power deregulation, saying it would result in lower costs and more customer choices. The company was hoping that deregulation would make itself attractive to investors and potential buyers. A deregulation bill, the Electric Utility Restructuring and Customer Choice Act, was introduced in March 1997, when the legislative session was nearly over. Lawmakers, most of them farmers and ranchers and businessmen, approved it hastily. To some critics of deregulation, the passage smacked of the era when Anaconda dictated what the Legislature should do. Few Montana lawmakers understood what was happening, said Ken Toole, a Democratic state senator and an opponent of the deregulation. "It was a steamroller with the mantra of free market," Toole said. "Debate took place in a compressed period of time and it was not brought before the public." Montana Power disputed that interpretation. Jack Haffey, its president and chief operating officer, said, "it was not a bill pulled out of somebody s pocket and foisted on the public." Still, Montana Power emerged with marketable power plants and its thriving Touch America business. The company sold its power plants to PPL, investing much of the proceeds in Touch America. Montana Power s shares, adjusted for an August 1999 split, soared to nearly $65 in March 2000 from less than $20 before deregulation. (The shares have since returned to a below-$20 range, closing on Friday at $16.48) Company insiders cashed in their stock options at the peak and some became rich. And, for a while at least, deregulation appeared to be working. Competition among power suppliers was pushing down the price of electricity . In January 1999, Montana Resources  power costs fell to $19 a megawatt hour from the regulated price of $30. But starting in June 2000, Stricker said, "the market started to go nuts." Rising demand, coupled with a lack of new supply, pushed up prices sharply. A megawatt hour spiked as high as $680 and then settled back into the $200-to-$400 range. The region s power crisis has been aggravated recently by a drought that has reduced the amount of hydroelectric power generated. Steve Walsh, a Montana Resources spokesman, said the company s suppliers told it that rates could reach $1,000 a megawatt hour in the third quarter. Montana  s labor force, meanwhile, has suffered. Since last summer, according to the Montana affiliate of the AFL-CIO, more than 1,000 workers have lost their jobs in layoffs caused by power price inflation."

We are checking to confirm that their facilities are in fact reaching their emission ceilings.Pressure builds on Davis to relax air standards  Updated: May 24, 2001 - 2:22 p.m.  A major electricity supplier said Thursday it will sharply cut prices for power from three Southern California plants in anticipation that air quality monitors will let the plants release more pollution this summer.  Meanwhile, aides said Gov. Gray Davis will consider paying businesses to run heavily polluting diesel generators to boost the state s power supply and help avert rolling blackouts.  Reliant Energy said it could chop its power bids from the high of $1,900 per megawatt hour Davis criticized this month to as little as $150 per megawatt hour -- but only if air regulators quickly allow it to exceed pollution standards at the three plants.  The Houston-based generator will cut its prices immediately, but will soon be forced to shut down three of its five Southern California plants for the rest of the year if pollution standards aren t lifted, said Joe Bob Perkins, president and CEO of Reliant Energy Wholesale Group.  Davis singled out Reliant s $1,900-per-megawatt-hour charge earlier this month as an example of the egregious prices he said generators should voluntarily cut.  Reliant said it deliberately bid the high price to discourage the state s power grid operator from calling its high-polluting plants into use. Using the plants now eats up valuable pollution credits that will likely be needed to keep the plants running during even higher demand periods this summer, the company said.  "In essence, we are doing exactly what Gov. Gray Davis has suggested. But if these restrictions are not lowered, we will run out of power from these units very quickly," Perkins said in a statement.  Perkins proposed that emissions hours not be counted against Reliant s yearly allotment whenever the plants are called into operation to help prevent blackouts.  Reliant s Mandalay, Etiwanda and Ellwood plants each face annual air pollution limits imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the Santa Barbara County and Ventura County air pollution control districts. Reliant has asked for extensions from each of the districts.  "There s no question we are in an emergency situation. We will consider every option available" to avert blackouts, said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. But he said the administration had not seen Reliant s proposal.  Davis also will consider paying businesses to fire up their backup generators when necessary to avoid outages, Salazar said. Running the generators would let the businesses disconnect from the state s power grid, freeing up electricity for other uses.  The proposals have consumer and environmental groups outraged.  "It s a short-term fix that will have potential long-term health consequences," said Paul Knepprath of the American Lung Association of California.  The state should instead cut demand by encouraging more conservation, the lung association and 18 other consumer and environmental groups said in a letter to Davis on Wednesday.  Davis already is promoting conservation, but blackouts have health and public safety consequences too, Salazar said. The use of backup generators is being proposed by the administration s top energy advisers, but Davis has not yet seen the proposal, Salazar said.  The governor is willing to "explore every conceivable option for generation this summer," Salazar said.  The twin developments come the same week the administration cut by 20 percent its estimate of new power generation that will be available this summer. Davis now projects 4,000 additional megawatts, 1,000 megawatts short of his original estimate. A megawatt is enough power for about 750 homes."

His message is approximately 90 percent consistent with Enron s on the wholesale level (He even called for Federal siting authority.).  He sees price caps as a stop gap only and votes for them as a last resort.  However, he still contradicts himself when he questions the use of single price auctions because they do not work as intended; but, he comments that PJM is working.  I and others will work with him to make sure he understands.  I spent time with Mike McLaughlin (Director of Corporate Applications) and Rob Cupina (Director of Rates, Central).  We spoke about the RTO filings due October 15.  I shared my concern that some of the RTO filings may be incomplete and asked what actions FERC may take if the filings are deficient.  Mike indicated that the RTO filings will be processed by the rate offices of the three regions (east, central and west) in Dan Larcamp s group (OMTR).  He believes that Order 2000 will become as "voluntary" as Order 436 was.If you would like to discuss or have particular questions, please do not hesitate to call -- 202.466.9150  JOE"

Townsend II, 202/586-5806                          Energy Department Report Identifies Barriers                      Blocking Competition In Electric Utility Industry                      Distributed Power Projects Could Reduce Power Outages           Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson today released a comprehensivereport that documents, for the           first time, the marketplace barriers that prevent electric utilitycustomers, developers and vendors from           creating projects that would enable consumers to generate their ownelectricity. According to the           Energy Department report, distributed power systems that produceelectricity onsite can reduce the           amount of power utility companies need during peak demand and helpprevent power outages.           "Hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of workhours are lost each year due to           power supply disruptions that could otherwise be avoided if thebarriers to distributed electricity           generation were removed," said Secretary Richardson. "When facilities such as hospitals and           businesses with computers or other critical electronic technology can get power from either the grid or           their own generating equipment, energy reliability and security willbe greatly improved."           The newly released Department of Energy (DOE) report contains a10-point action plan for reducing the           technical, business practice and regulatory barriers that discourageinterconnection of distributed           generation technologies to the electricity grid in the United States. The report, Making Connections:           Case Studies of Barriers to Interconnection of Distributed Power, isthe first to document the problems           the developers of distributed electricity generation projectsencounter while attempting to interconnect           to the electric grid.           Onsite generation, also known as distributed electricity generation,allows residential, commercial and           industrial customers to produce their own electricity by usingsmaller, decentralized, electrical           generation systems located at or close to their facilities. Powersources for distributed electricity           generation systems include fuel cells, microturbines, photovoltaics,wind turbines and combined heat           and power systems. The technology reduces the need to build new large central generating plants or           transmission and distribution lines. The report concludes,distributed power systems at industrial           plants or commercial buildings can be more energy efficient andprovide greater reliability onsite than           conventional central generating stations.           The Energy Department examined 65 distributed electricity generationprojects. Of the 65 case           studies, only seven reported no major utility-related barriers.However, in most cases, substantial           regulatory, technical and business-practice barriers exist, whichinhibit distributed generation           interconnection to the grid in the United States. For example, 17projects, more than 25 percent of the           case studies, experienced delays greater than four months.           Other findings include:                Lack of a national consensus on technical standards forconnecting equipment.                Lengthy and costly approval process that hampers competitionfrom smaller distributed                generation projects.                Unfamiliarity by utility companies in dealing withcustomer-generator interconnection requests.                Costly regulatory appeals that prevent relatively small-scaledistributed generation projects.           Although a handful of public utility commissions across the countryhave adopted rules on           interconnection, the report concludes that removal of the barrierswill require the participation of           industry, utilities, developers, environmental groups and state andfederal regulatory agencies. The           report outlines an action plan for reducing barriers to distributedgeneration. Some of the           recommendations include:                Adoption of uniform technical standards for interconnectingdistributed power to the electric grid.                Acceleration of the development of distributed power controltechnology and systems.                Development of tools for utilities to assess the value andimpact of distributed power at any                point on the grid.                Establishment of new regulatory tariffs and utility incentivesthat help reduce regulatory barriers.           According to the report, many of the artificial market barriers todistributed generation grow out of           long-standing regulatory policies and incentives designed to supportmonopoly supply. Distributed           generation promises greater customer choices, efficiency advantages,improved reliability and a host of           environmental benefits.           Copies of the report are available athttp://www.eren.doe.gov/distributedpower/barriersreport/           Secretary Richardson discussed the report s findings during remarkstoday at an electricity reliability           summit in Akron, Ohio. During the summit, government officials,regulators, labor representatives,           utility company executives and consumers discussed ways to enhancethe reliability of Ohio s electric           system. Since late April, Secretary Richardson has co-hosted similarsummits in Hartford, Newark,           New Orleans, Sacramento, Seattle and Houston.                                             - DOE -(See attached file: MAKING CONNNECTIONS.pdf) - MAKING CONNNECTIONS.pdf"

How should we describe the Change of Control exception forWarburg, in light of the term sheet that gives Warburg rights to futurefinancing.  Should we stick with the single transaction?	2.	We need to confirm the response time in Section 6.6(d).Kiodex wants to change 0.25 sec to 2 or 3 sec.	3.	We need to confirm what information will be included in theEnron Transaction Data, and which data Kiodex will have to extract or add.	4.	I deleted the termination right in Section 8.3(k) on theassumption that we are going to a concurrent closing.	5.	I would like to confirm that the definition of the KiodexApplication is okay.

Please make a note of these dates and perform any required actions.  If you have questions, please contact me.December 15:  All PRC meetings and ratings will be finalized for Sr. Director and below positions.January 25:  Performance reviews must be completed by this date.  All performance review information, including bonus payment and salary increase, must be communicated to employees.February 5:  Bonus payment made to eligible employees.Since we have many new employees, I thought I would provide the following information and philosophy about our performance review system.  Enron is very proud of its employees and is known for hiring the most talented people available in the marketplace.  I believe that is true in West Power Trading.  The challenge for managers is to provide valuable feedback, and the most accurate rating, to employees so they can enhance their performance and progress in their current roles and within the company.There are basically two objectives to our performance review system.Career Development/Feedback on Performance:  This part of our performance review system includes the meetings and discussions surrounding the following four documents that are in each review package:  Goals, Expectations, Accomplishments, Feedback.  Employees prepare a listing of their Goals to accomplish by the next review period and a list of their Accomplishments since the previous review period.  Managers prepare Feedback and prepare a list of Expectations during the next review period.  These documents are the cornerstone for constructive two-way feedback during a performance review.Performance Rating:  Enron uses a merit-based approach to determine promotions, raises, and bonuses.  This is accomplished in the PRC (Performance Review Committee) meetings.  In these meetings, the ENA management team assigns a performance rating to each employee.  We attempt to make this process as fair and objective as possible.  For West Power Trading employees, each person s performance is assessed relative to responsibilities defined in the "Expectations" document.  Performance is also gauged relative to your peers throughout ENA--Portland, Houston, and Calgary.  Each person s manager had tremendous input into this process.  I personally represented each person in our group in the final ENA PRC meeting in Houston.  I feel confident the process was fair and that the tremendous achievements of our office were acknowledged.The following is a review of the various rating categories.NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Does not meet most expectations.  Demonstrates some of the criteria.  Further development needed in most areas.SATISFACTORY:  Meets many but not all expectations.  Demonstrates most of the criteria.  Further development needed in many areas.STRONG:  Meets most and exceeds some expectations.  Role model for some of the criteria.  Further development needed in some areas.EXCELLENT:  Exceeds most expectations.  Role model for most criteria.  Further development needs are minimal.SUPERIOR:  Consistently goes above and beyond expectations.  Role model for criteria.  Very little need for growth and change at current level.My commitment to you is that by January 25, you will receive your career/development feedback and your performance rating.  Hopefully this information aids you in understanding the PRC review system.  If you have any questions about the process, please see your manager or me.  Also, Amy FitzPatrick would be happy to answer any questions you have or provide assistance with the PRC Process."

So in order to         make sure that portcalc values the deals the same way as before, it is necessary for the traders to paste the 6 x 8 values in excel into the 7 x 8 column          of the position manager. This exception is only applicable to the daily portion of the off peak curve.2) Is there a way to fill down on cells like you can in excel?         There is no way of doing this right now. I ll make sure that we include this feature in future versions.3) Is there a reason Rockies is set up as a region? - It is a basis to Palo - shouldwe set this up as a basis so they can mark this (currently it is flat to Palo)      It is treated as a region by portcalc. It will adversely affect the portcalc result if we treat this as a basis.4) When I go to mark the Basis - each one shows up twice in the drop down.(ie Mead, Mead, Mona, Mona ........)       I ll fix it ASAP5) How are we supposed to be marking Sunday s?    Currently Sundays are a percentage(75) of the peak curve. Only the front two months can be edited in the system. Rest of the values are automatically computed. Also is there going to be a manual on the position managers for reference?    We are in the process of writing a manual for the position manager.Thanks Arun,Heather"

The effect is an additional $1.2MM a year of depreciation for 2001.  I am not sure what Kevin is looking at, but Jenny s 2001 Plan had $17.4MM and we are currently forecasting $17.3MM for 2001.With regard to the Capital Charge issue.  The interest rate that we were told to use by Delainey was 9% - we have since found out that Lavo is using 8.5% - therefore, in June we will credit the New Albany project with $218K of interest.  Again, Jenny s plan showed $11.8 and the 2001 forecast is $11.8(using 8.5%).  The estimate using 8% is $10.7MM.Finally, there is only $54K remaining in New Albany s major maintenance account.  We stopped booking a per start accrual sometime last year on all of the Peakers since none of the plants except New Albany were using the reserve.  If my memory serves me correctly, Kelley Huntley and Jenny Latham met with Jody, myself and Scott Chambers in OEC to make this decision - and Jenny discussed it with Kevin.  There was nothing planned for major maintenance.Please feel free to forward this on to Kevin so that he and Lavorato can resolve these issues.  Let me know if you or Kevin need any additional information regarding New Albany.theresax58173 -----Original Message-----From: 	Pierce, Jody  Sent:	Tuesday, June 12, 2001 1:49 PMTo:	Vos, TheresaSubject:	FW: New Albany -----Original Message-----From: 	Zisman, Stuart  Sent:	Tuesday, June 12, 2001 8:48 AMTo:	Pierce, JodySubject:	New AlbanyI am not sure if I mentioned the depreciation issue on the voicemail.  The issue is that there was an increase in the capital cost of the plant (due to additional upgrades and CAPEX that was done after Kevin s agreement with Lavo was cut).  This resulted in an increase in the actual depreciation figures.  Kevin feels that his original deal, based upon the cost of the plant at the time, should be honored.Stuart"

Realtors - The McQueeney office (not the Seguin office).  The phone number is 830-557-5824.  Ask to work with Jackie specifically.  Jackie knows Elizabeth s family, The Otts, and me.  I am better friends with her husband - he drives boats and teaches kids how to ski for the Ski Lodge.You will find a wide variety of homes on McQueeney.  The balance will be between location, lot size and how nice you may want the existing structure to be.  As for location, the prime areas will be:1) Near the Lake Breeze Ski Lodge (near the Ott s house) 2) Water front on and around "the Island"  (just as nice maybe nicer- more to choose from)3) Waterfront "Up-River"  - Generally larger lots, less consistency in quality of homesExpect values from $150 - $250k for a lot only.  houses will run from $350k - your limit.  Last time we were on the lake I noticed several new For Sale signs as you would expect.The more I think about it, this lake is ideal for where you live.  It takes me 2:20 ish from my house and should take you no more than 2 hours from where you live today.Let me know how things are going and if you are ever planning to head up there I will check my schedule and show you around if possible.  One thing to consider is going up on a Saturday morning and getting a room at The Lake Breeze Ski Lodge.  Drive around with Jackie during the am/afternoon and get Sambo (Jackie s husband) to take you and the family out on the boat for an hour or so (Sambo has a couple of Ski Nautiques).  The lodge has a great pool, bar, dining, and playground.  It is open weekends only through mid October I believe.  Open full time while school is out.  Rooms are about $65 and they are what you would expect.  A nice family/social place on the lake.  Of course, if we are there, we would be happy to take everyone out on the boats and such, but if we aren t everything is accessible through the lodge.Good luck,RH"

Steve had been trading their term Midwest book and has previously covered the SE I believe.  I think Steve is a good trader, played the regional/time spreads very effectively, and is not afraid to put size on when appropriate.  I just think that Reliant s management team is "old school" and Steve was not being able to effectuate the changes he saw necessary (apparently, they would not even let him trade NG against his positions). Steve just wanted to clear his head and get away.  He is looking at the opportunities everyone else is at the moment and is not in a rush.  I know he wants to work with a bright group that thinks the way he does.  I have told him that he should talk to you guys.  You may want to contact him directly when you have the green light to look outside ENE.  I have known Steve for awhile and think he could be a good fit - I think Fletch has met him and dealt with him in the markets as well. Steve s cell number is 713-962-0274.

All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn t on.  ?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC s to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  o	Red - Move Teamo	Orange - Desktop Support/ITo	Green - Telephony?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.

If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled..	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  ?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new buildingI hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.

283745,chairman.enron@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide1@enron.com,"X-FileName: erol mclaughlin 6-26-02.PSTAs things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.Organizational MattersThe Creditors  Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors  Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron s most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors  Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.Personnel MattersAs a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.Office of the Chairman - Enron CorpJeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor s Committee.Treasurer - Enron CorpRay Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.Corporate DevelopmentMark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron s various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron s reorganization plan and value preservation.Wholesale ServicesThe Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron s reorganization plan.Management Committee DeparturesUnfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:Michael BrownMark FrevertSteve KeanMike McConnellJeff ShankmanAdditionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone s patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal."

Sent: Monday, February 04, 2002 8:24 PMTo: Johnson, JeffCc: Rao, Ramesh; Pena, Matt; Clark, Cynthia; Schomer, Chris; Bennett, Stephen W.Subject: PROGRESS REPORT - Netco testing schedule for Monday, Feb 4thBelow is an end of day progress report on Monday s regression test. Summary:  We did complete as planned the 25 types of transactions, including global data setup, deal entry (EOL, Sitara, TDS, EnPower) scenarios.    EOL passed us 25 Gas and 40 power scenarios of which we tested a subset of transactions.  Today s test went a bit smoother given we pushed for the counterparties, contracts to be setup in advance.  We will continue with the Gas settlement on Tuesday morning, along with SAP processing at 1:00pm. From a technical code perspective, there were no major interface issues.  Including TDS/ Sitara interface to Tagg as discussed earlier.Errors reported include continued NT userid "pilot burn-in" issues, as well as replication issues with data.  Given we are processing in a very  truncated  environment, downstream systems can have missing global data needed (regions, facilities, SAP information).  The open issues are being escalated and should be addressed by 10:00am tomorrow morning. The goals of this regression test on Monday/ Tuesday are:1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Power Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books) 2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have  ENRON  reference, or  EOL  reference3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, including SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading session for on 2/7 (see below) 5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo. 6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT until remaining are ported.  Accomplishments/  what worked?1) Confirmation/ updates of most recent price curves into ERMS.  The data prior was from mid December.2) Working with only the subset of counterparties as authorized as  Active 3) EOL deals did flow downstream.  However, the major were future periods that we cannot settle.  We modified the data to correspond to what downstream needed.4) Gas - Volume Management, Logistics, and leading into Settlement5) Power/ Financial  - EnPower/ Tagg, confirmations, leading into settlement  What did not?1) Canada testing is still catching up, but improving.  They are identifying the counterparties, pipelines, test scenarios and anticipate continuing to test Tuesday.   2) Facilities missing, Canada pipelines missing, contracts not replicating into Unify (resolved). 3) Unify Tagg Deal Load.  The Unify Tagg Deal load was discovered at 5pm, and will be addressed early Tuesday am. Focus on TuesdayGiven the new SAP environment has not been tested to date, we will monitor the Unify transmission/ SAP processing (scheduled for 1pm till).  There is much risk within SAP given the new counterparties, entities, xref tables, SAP information is just being setup.  We will also validate the intercompany transactions created on Monday. Note:  Tuesday night (6pm - 8pm) is the scheduled NetCo test with Estate Shutdown.

This section of your  lot will basically be a wildlife preserve where you cannot build or change the  lay of the land or flow of water. I went to the lot, but it was too wooded to see  much without walking all the way back.  It was getting really cloudy and I  didn t want to get caught in a rain, so I did not walk to the back... but I did  get several plats which answer questions.  Garrett usually charges an  additional $5,000 for a walkout basement... but I have not received an answer as  to whether they can positively accommodate a walk out basement on that  lot. I got the contract and all pertinent info from  Valerie s office.  Everything looks good, including the agency disclosure I  was asking about.  I do want a release from Garrett for that lot from the  previous purchaser so there s no doubt about their consent.  I ll talk to  Valerie about it. Will talk to you soon....Tracey :-) - ~MAP0003.PDF"

However, I felt like I had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following. Dave Forster & I met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group. I was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual. I was allowed to move dollars but NOT allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group. Frankly, the numbers seemed pretty low.  Assuming the goal is to retain key employees for Netco, I am not confident these numbers will achieve this. I know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company. I have asked them to be patient, not make any quick decisions, and give us a chance to see this through. Dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations. As you know, mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end. The mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end. I understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available. However, because the retention numbers were based on this, they are significantly lower. My intentions are not to show any disrepect to Dave by discussing this with you but I wanted to make sure my thoughts /opinions were communicated to you. If Dave has already discussed this with you, I apologize for the duplication.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me. I am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713-446-9669. Thank you for your time.Jennifer"

JOHN LAVORATO"For the Record"In just over 8 fast-paced years, John Lavorato has evolved from an MBA student at Northwestern University to president and CEO of Enron Americas.  Joining Enron in 1993 as an associate, he moved up the ranks quickly. He moved to Calgary and performed many functions for Enron Canada that included leading the trading operation from January 1995 and the origination business from January 1998.  After successfully growing the Canadian trading and origination business into a major contributor to Enron Corp., he was named president and CEO of Enron Canada Corp in 1999."

These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.  EA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.  However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.  Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.  Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.  Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.Thank you for your cooperation."

Theproblems are worsened by the particular mixture of controls and marketforces which combine to create imbalances.  Specifically, while retailprices are capped, wholesale prices are market-determined except that thereare restrictions against long-term hedging.  This is a recipe for high andvolatile short-term power prices, which we have seen.Our view is unchanged that price controls set at a meaningfully low levelwill cause blackouts by creating an imbalance between supply and demand.This is elementary economics.  Price controls reduce supply (electrons flowelsewhere seeking higher prices and power plants don t get built) whiledemand remains artificially high (customers respond to the low, controlledprices by maintaining consumption at high levels).Price caps are THE issue now facing the industry.  We think meaningfully lowcaps will not be instituted.  If they are, they contain a "self-repeal"mechanism -- i.e., blackouts.  In our view, the only way to bring supply anddemand into equilibrium is through market-determined prices coupled with newinvestment in power plants, electric transmission lines, gas pipelines, etc. <<INTERESTING MEDIA ARTICLE 5-30-01.doc>>Raymond C.

The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission s powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties  ability to comply.

This acquisition would buy us time and give us a jump start in developing our capacity trading tools but we also need to be aware that there will be additional costs going forward and potentially some issues with maintenance of the data feeds from the pipes if we don t finalize TPA s with all of the pipes.  -  Tommy -----Original Message-----From: 	Kitchen, Louise  Sent:	Tuesday, July 31, 2001 2:38 PMTo:	Yanowski, Tommy J.; Gomez, Julie A.Cc:	Perlman, Beth; Stock, StephenSubject:	RE: Capacity Center Due DiligenceI have to say there are lots of issues with this. -----Original Message-----From: 	Yanowski, Tommy J.

In the last two days,  we have seen two signals suggesting that the Bush Administration will not significantly deviate from the "broker" role played by the Clinton White House:1. In his confirmation hearing this morning, Treasury Secretary-Designate O Neill cautioned that "it is not clear that US intervention is needed in California" and that the "Governor must be the first line of defense."2. A source close to Bush economic advisor Larry Lindsey reported to us yesterday that "there was little that the Federal government could do specifically to help, beyond focusing on national issues (increased production, transmission capacity etc.)."Of course, the Bush Treasury officials are likely to be more cautious with respect to intervention than the Energy team, as was true with the Clinton Administration.  Yet Lindsey in particular is unlikely to deviate far from the official Bush view at this stage.  Further guidance should be forthcoming with respect to this issue from Energy Secretary-Designate Spence Abraham s testimony tomorrow."

Dabei waere eine hoheDatenfrequenz ideal (taeglich, ansonsten woechentlich odermonatlich). Zusaetzlich waeren auch Spotpreise fuer WTI mitLieferung in Cushing nuetzlich.Diese idealen Datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nichterfuellen lassen.

Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15thDecember, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in adelegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas andNew York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sureyou can appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need tobe taken into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are requiredas soon as possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request youbring your presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppydisc or a laptop.2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of whataudio-visual requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection -notably PowerPoint).3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If youhave not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to mycolleague, Claire as soon as possible.If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contactme, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.Kind regardsAndreas_____________________________Andreas  SimouGARP 2001 - Conference ProducerTel +44 (0) 20 7626  9301Fax +44 (0) 20 7626 9900Don t miss the GARP 2001 Convention,program  details via our web sitewww.garp.com(See attached file: speaker checklist.doc)"

As you might have heard from Lance and Alex we are going through atransition period having doubled the number of universities and industrymembers within the last year. Consequently, our business processes are notwell developed. One of the problems we are facing is the balance between theelectrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interestedin market related research. I hope to recruit more of the later so tat wehave more of a constituency in the Advisory Board  that sees the value ofmarket related research. I already have a verbal commitment from people atElectrabell that expressed interest in joining PSERC. With members likeElectrabell and Enron we will be able to support more market Stem projectssuch as the one that Shijie Deng proposed (not funded in this round). Pleaselet me know if I can do anything to facilitate the decision at Enron. I amgoing to be in Austin on January 19 to participate at a PUCT hearing andcould come through Huston for a visit.

The Mystery Lives On.Larry LaPrise put his right foot, as well as the rest of himself, in the grave April 4, age 83. Those who remember the exquisite torture that is the Hokey Pokey will find bittersweet news of its inventor s death. While most may remember the dance as a staple of grade-school music class, La Prise actually invented it for the "apr?s-ski" crowd at an Idaho resort in the 40s. The scandalous part of the story is that he almost certainly stole it. But from whom?The song was recorded as a novelty a couple of times but it didn t become a source of steady income for LaPrise until Roy Acuff bought the rights to it in the 60s.Alas, the Hokey Pokey turned out to be the high-water mark of LaPrise s musical career-in fact, the only water mark. LaPrise, by then a father of six, was working for the post office in Ketchum, Idaho.There followed a steady succession of recordings: Jack Johnson and the Hickory Dickory Singers, Warren Covington with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Cliffie Stone, Jerry Marks, Chubby Checker, Annette Funicello, the Champs. In no time, the Hokey Pokey was everywhere. Other versions include, "Hokey Pokey Cow Bell Blues," "Hokey Pokey Mama," and "Hokey Pokey Polka."By the early 1990s, it had even turned up on a heavy metal album by the band Haunted Garage, alongside such classics as "Party in the Graveyard" and "Torture Dungeon"."The Hokey Pokey  is like a square dance, really,   LaPrise said in 1992. "You turn around. You shake it all about. Everyone is in a circle, and it gets them all involved.  The tune became the official victory dance for the Iowa State Football team.     I guarantee you we never had a big victory where we were the underdog or won a championship game or had a bowl victory that we didn t do the Hokey Pokey and celebrate,   Coach Hayden Fry said. I would have sent him a note. I m sure he never dreamed that he made a contribution in athletics.   But the really shocking part is that the song may have been stolen.Lexington, KY resident Bob Degen claims the folk song is his.Degen, 90, owns a 1944 copyright for "The Hokey-Pokey Dance," and claims to have written the words and music. His copyright predates LaPrise s by six years."He s a faker," Degen said of LaPrise. In fact, Degen sued LaPrise in 1956 in U.S. District Court in California. According to Degen, the two parties settled out of court to split 40 percent of the royalties. Degen is adamant that he wrote the song without any influences. The truth, unusually, seems to lie not in between but without: Pure Invention is rare.A December 1945 issue of Dance magazine contains an article about an English novelty song called "the Okey Cokey," which American GIs were said to have danced to in England during WWII.You put your left arm in. You put your left arm out, And shake it all about. You do the okey-cokey And you turn about. And that s what it s all about." In his 1940 book, The Gift to be Simple, Edward Deming Andrews described a song called "The Hinkum-Booby" that was sung by Shakers in Kentucky:"I put my right hand in,I put my right hand out, I give my right hand a shake, And I turn it all about." So everybody in the copyright dispute was stealing from the great well of traditional folksong. As are all who try to be original with materials we hope will find resonance.Dale RasmussenTel:  (503) 464-8863 Fax: (503) 464-8058"

327480,debra.davidson@enron.com,"portland.desk@enron.com,dan.dietrich@enron.com,dan.dietrich@enron.com","Enron requires that we purchase all of our equipment through a central purchasing process.  The reasons for doing this are two fold.  1) Enron supports only certain technologies.  It is important to standardize the technology sitting on each person s desktop to ensure it works with other technology already on your desk and that the IT staff knows how to support the use of this technology.2) Enron has cut deals with suppliers that give us good prices.  In the past, the Portland office has not strictly adhered to this policy.  We had good business reasons for not complying--we could buy the same equipment at the same price a lot faster if we just bought it ourselves locally.Here s the problem.  People have not always bought the "same" equipment.  For example, people have recently purchased flat screen monitors that are different than the Compaq flat screens that most of us use.  This requires our technology group to understand how the different screens work, whether they need different drivers installed on your hard drive, and what to do with them if they break.  There are numerous other examples.  In aggregate, this practice has put additional strains on our already constrained technology support staff and will cause us problems in the future if any of the non-standard equipment breaks and can t be fixed or replaced in a hurry.Accordingly, Dave Steiner and I would appreciate it if you would do the following when purchasing technology.All pending and future purchasing requests should now go through the local IT Department.  Please send an email to the "IT Portland" email account when you have an IT related need such as a Palm Pilot, LCD screen, special software, etc.  The local IT team will then assure compliance and availability of the requested item(s) and get back to you with cost, ETA, and any other relevant information.If the centralized Houston purchasing process is too slow to meet our business need, IT Portland will investigate buying the exact same product locally. Again, our goal is to streamline the process while conforming to corporate standards.

These assets are viable businesses that represent Enron s roots.  If we are able to move quickly, we believe this 363 Sale process will allow us to maximize the value of these assets.We intended to rollout our plan to employees early next week following the presentation to the Creditors  Committee.  However, the Wall Street Journal got a relatively final draft of our plan and were prepared to run a story today.  To ensure accuracy, we decided to work with the Journal on their story and I participated in an interview late yesterday afternoon.I certainly regret that you have to learn about our plans from the media rather than directly from me or other members of the management team.  Yet until we present to the Creditors  Committee, we are still not at liberty to share the full details of the plan with employees.  We look forward to proceeding with our rollout early next week.  In the meantime, we ve attached below the article from the Wall Street Journal.Enron Plans Return to Its Roots --- Draft Proposal to Creditors Envisions a Smaller Firm Focused on Hard AssetsBy Rebecca Smith and Mitchell PacelleThe Wall Street Journal	Enron Corp. plans to reorganize as a small company under a new name, according to a draft copy of the firm s plans -- returning to its roots of a decade ago, before the aggressive strategy that led to its spectacular expansion and then collapse. 	Under plans scheduled to be presented to creditors Friday, Enron would carve out a small integrated energy company with assets of about $10 billion in North and South America. The new entity would likely take a new name in order to escape the taint of Enron s fall and the baggage of numerous investigations into its finances.	It would then be put on the block in bankruptcy court, quickly giving Enron s creditors the choice to retain a stake in the new company -- or sell it off, whole or in parts, if more attractive bids emerge. 	Enron lost the confidence of creditors and investors as revelations emerged last fall that the Houston-based company had hid debt and pumped up profit through a series of off-balance-sheet ventures that in some cases enriched a handful of senior executives. After failing to merge with rival Dynegy Corp., the company sought bankruptcy-court protection in December, the largest such filing in U.S. history. 	The new plan calls for a small operating company -- for now dubbed "OpCO Energy Co." -- to own power plants, electric utilities, natural-gas pipelines and liquefied-natural-gas facilities, but little else. The biggest properties would be the Portland General Electric utility in Oregon; Elektro, a Sao Paulo-based Brazilian utility and about 15,000 miles of pipeline assets on both continents -- less than half the amount of pipes that Enron once possessed. 	The plan would essentially make the Enron successor little different from other U.S. energy companies that provide electricity and natural gas, giving it few advantages over competitors. It would also make the new company more reliant than ever on volatile South American operations at a time when its U.S. rivals are scaling back their commitments in the region. 	Nevertheless, Enron s new management team, headed since January by restructuring specialist Stephen Cooper, hopes that the creation of a new company will protect the assets it needs from a long bankruptcy-reorganization process that could hurt their value. Under the company s plan, all of Enron s other assets would be liquidated in that process. The number of employees would drop steeply -- from about 23,000 today (already down from a peak of 31,000 before the bankruptcy) to around 12,000. 	"In my view, we re going to be in bankruptcy for a number of years, because of the difficulty we re going to have resolving all of the claims," Mr. Cooper said in an interview yesterday afternoon, after Enron s board had met to go over the plan. 	A spinoff, he said, also could protect the new business from problems stemming from the bankruptcy such as customers wary of entering into new contracts and a welter of litigation and competing claims. Customers who otherwise might shun Enron could embrace the new company, Mr. Cooper predicted: "Once we re out from under, what they will see is a company with great assets and great cash flow that can stand on its own two legs." 	Enron s creditors wield enormous influence over how the bankruptcy reorganization will unfold. Mr. Cooper and his advisers will have to convince these unsecured creditors -- who have asserted billions of dollars in claims -- that they stand to recover more of their money by turning Enron s core assets into a new company than selling them off in a fire sale. Because Enron now owes a fiduciary obligation to them, these creditors have the power to press the company to alter the plan considerably, or to proceed directly to a liquidation. 	"The [creditors ] committee has a bunch of bright, reasonable businesspeople on it," said Mr. Cooper. "Their goal, to maximize value, is consistent with ours. I m confident that we will be able to make a case for value maximization by adopting this approach." 	Luc Despins, a lawyer for the creditors  committee, said he hadn t yet seen the plan and couldn t comment. 	Protracted negotiations are likely to follow the Friday meeting. If and when Enron reaches an accord with creditors, Enron will file the plan with the bankruptcy court, which must then approve it. 	The proposed reorganization would sweep away a decade of rapid growth, returning the company to its size in 1992, when former Chairman Kenneth Lay and then-President Richard Kinder were running the company. Four years later, Mr. Kinder left Enron and was replaced by Jeffrey Skilling, under whose leadership the company began to disparage hard assets and emphasize the energy-trading business that eventually turned Enron into a far larger concern. 	Whether the new company can escape the taint of Enron is far from certain. "The success of OpCo as a going concern will depend on its ability to separate reputationally from Enron," the draft business plan says. In addition to winning support from creditors, Enron must disentangle itself from many complicated financial arrangements and an existing agreement to sell Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co., a deal which hasn t yet closed. 	In recent months, new managers have devoted considerable energy to trying to understand Enron s complicated financial arrangements. They are also trying to unravel the contents of a plethora of "SPEs" or special-purpose entities. They were created, beginning in the mid-1990s, as a way to pump up profits, hide debt and raise money from outside investors. 	The draft plan contains a list of assets Enron wishes to retain for the new company, some of which may be entangled in these special-purpose entities. For example, Centragas, a pipeline company in Colombia, is a proposed asset of the new company. But separate, internal spreadsheets reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show that controlling interest of that pipeline already had been pledged to two investment vehicles, Rawhide LP and Whitewing LP. They, in turn, may have passed along interests to other Enron entities, Tombstone Assets LLC and Ponderosa Assets LP. 	The company said it is trying to "unwind" many of the investment vehicles to gain clear title to the assets for the new company, but it cautioned that "the unwind and resolution of these structures may affect the financial results presented" for the new company. 	If the new company is created as outlined, its pro forma net income -- based on past performance of the units it hopes to retain -- is projected to be $243 million this year, $352 million next year, $450 million in 2004 and $503 million by 2005. That is based on assets of $10.1 billion currently, rising to $11 billion by 2003. 	That s a far cry from what Enron claimed at its peak. In 2000, the last year that full financial records were posted by the company, Enron said its net income was $979 million on $100.8 billion in revenue. Those numbers -- as well as financial statements in the previous three years -- were eventually retracted as Enron came under increasing scrutiny from investors and regulators. 	The plan said the company wants to keep enough assets to form the basis of a new company because the market is "already overloaded with properties for sale" and prices aren t very good. Enron s collapse is partly to blame for that market glut, because credit standards have been tightening, forcing many energy firms to shed assets and pare debt."

We now need to develop a methodology to calculate the Vestas definition using VisuPro data.  I think this boils down to:Vestas Avail = (SOT+WOT+EST+RT+MT)/(ST-LOT)Where:SOT = System Okay TimeEST = External Stop TimeWOT = Weather Out TimeLOT = Line Out TimeDT = Down TimeRT = Repair TimeMT = Maintenance TimeST = SOT+EST+WOT+LOT+DT+RT+MTThis calculation is based on an operating assumption that the current day machines are placed into "pause" mode during maintenance and repair time.  As a result the availability counters will continue to increment even when the turbine is being serviced.  Let s get together and discuss,Hollis"

I think that I have found the missing volumes on Big Cowboy.  There are two wells connected to system 429, which flows into the Big Cowboy system and interconnects with HGPL at Meter 8284.  They are meters 986679 (currently in Trade Zone 18) and 986742 (Currently in Trade Zone 1).  I think that these should probably both be reassigned to Trade Zone 21.  This should resolve our volumetric issue.Donna & George,Please let me know if my assumption is in error.  I have a schematic that shows these meters going to HGPL off of GEPL Big Cowboy, however, if this is not correct then I will need to try to find the gas in another manner.Thank you for your time.

Is it a sale that is goingto AEP.  I know we are serving a small Entex point off of Oasis.

I assume that you have talked with both Mary Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has only recently assumed Mary s duties within Global Databases) can best discuss how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Much effort has been put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except for on an ad hoc, manual basis. What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading positions properly,  let s take advantage of our in house knowledge and share counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data population efforts. Your comments and ideas are welcome. Debbie"

Specifically, we are asking the origination groups to describe their current strategy, detail the top 5 commercial deals/opportuntities for 2000 and to discuss any resource or organizational issues facing the unit.  Each trading organization will be asked to give a short market overview of their markets, identify three market or trading opportunities and discuss any resource or organizational issues facing that group.

I disagree that the functionality in TWS represents a fraud or control risk.  There is segregation of responsibilities within TWS which requires 2 different individuals to either initiate or change payment instruction.  This control has been audited repeatedly and has been determined to be sound and adequate control.  As with any bank operation, it is necessary for Treasury to be able to correct fatal errors.  We have implemented procedural controls so that GCP is notified of any issues with counterparty data.  I understand that GCP is responding promptly.

This review has included the interaction between Settlements and Cash Management / TWS system. One issue which we have identified is that the Cash Management Team have the ability in TWS to change the counterparty bank account details which have been fed into TWS via GCP and SAP.  Whilst procedurally, the cash management team do not edit these details, the fact remains that they could if they wanted to.  At best this presents operational risks (someone might edit the details in error) and at worst, presents opportunity for fraud. In order to ensure effective segregation of duties and minimise the operational risk we would like to remove the ability for the Cash Management Team to make these changes and restrict the entry point for this data just to the GCP Team.  We understand from Anne Hicks that you would need to sign off on such a functional / coding change in TWS. Sam Kemp, Head of GCP, and I are in Houston next week and I believe we have some time in your diary so we can discuss.

Audioconferencing just might be your solution. But, audioconferencing isn t always as simple as it seems. Consider the following tips when you pick up the phone for that next meeting. Leader	Pick an appropriate time for the meeting. Avoid lunchtime hours, if possible. Be prompt and end on time. Conduct a roll call. For large audiences, use Listen Only mode, which mutes all participants until they re queued to talk. Also use an attended service level, which offers a conference coordinator to help manage the call. To share a PowerPoint presentation, use Net Conferencing. Participants view the presentation on the Web while listening to you on an audioconference. You control the pace of the presentation and it ensures that participants don t jump ahead. If a follow-up meeting is required, select a mutual time and date before the call is over. Follow-up via e-mail. Leader & Participants	Speak clearly and avoid outside conversations or background noise. Identify yourself by name when speaking and address other individuals by name. Use your voice effectively; vary the tone and pace. Use the mute button if you are not speaking. If you do not have access to a mute button, press *6 on your telephone keypad to mute and unmute yourself. Receive a Free Web RSVP!Effective February 1, schedule a domestic attended-level audioconference or Net conference, add Instant Replay PlusSM, and you ll receive a free Web RSVP -- up to $100!* Instant Replay Plus allows individuals who missed your meeting access to a digital recording that they can listen to at their convenience.

Ihave been remiss in writing this and I am very sorry for mythoughtlessness in not having written before. Iwill bring you up to date now, but, before you read on,please sit down.YOU ARE NOT TO READ ANY FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE SITTING DOWN.OKAY! Well, then, I am getting along pretty well now. Theskull fracture and the concussion I got when I jumped out ofthe window of my dormitory when it caughtfire shortly after my arrival are pretty well healed now. Ionly get those sick headaches once a day.Fortunately the fire in the dormitory and my jump werewitnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm,and he was the one who called the fire departmentand the ambulance. He also visited me at the hospital and,since I had nowhere to live because of the burned outdormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to sharehis apartment with him. It s really a basement room, butit s kind of cute.He is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love andare planning to be married. We haven t set the exact dateyet, but it will be before my pregnancybegins to show.Yes, Mother and Dad, I am pregnant. I know how much you arelooking forward to being grandparents and I know you willwelcome the baby and give it the love,devotion and tender care you gave me when I was a child.The reason for the delay in our marriage is that myboyfriend has some minor infection, which prevents us frompassing our pre-marital blood tests, and Icarelessly caught it from him. This will soon clear up withthe penicillin injections I am having daily. I know you willwelcome him into our family with open arms. He is kind and,although not well educated, he is ambitious. Although he isof a different race and religion than ours, I know youroften-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be botheredby the fact that his skin color is somewhat different fromours. I am sure you will love him as I do.His family background is good too, for I am told that hisfather is an important gun-bearer in the village from whichhe came.Now that I have brought you up to date, I want to tell youthat there was no dormitory fire, I did not have aconcussion or a skull fracture. I was not in the hospital, Iam not pregnant, I am not engaged. I do not have syphilisand there is no man in my life.However, I am getting a  D  in History and an  F  in Scienceand I wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.Yours,Your Loving Daughter."

For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.   With respect to your specific suggestion below, we are fine with this approach if it follows the discussion suggested here.

Dick says by next week he will have his financing lined up with the lenders only having outs if there is a substantial change in the economics of the deal due to regulatory action.  He expects Oregon PUC approval in late May.  He believes that he needs approval from the creditors committee by early February.  He stated that his team is getting questioned  on the timing of the creditor committee approval.  He was pretty insistent that early February should be plenty of time to get approval on a deal of this magnitude.I told Dick the the Creditor Committee had a mountain of work to do and thought everyone involved needed to understand the complexities of the bankruptcy process before such a large deal was put before the Creditor Committee.  He recognized that but stated the DIP banks were also asking his people about the sales process and timing and thought they would want affirmation that the deal was getting Creditor Committee approval.I told Dick that we would try to move the process along and thought early to mid February was the quickest we could hope to get Creditor Committee approval.  (This was based on our conversation in Jeff s office that we would know betterabout the timing in 4 to 6 weeks.Dick plans on us talking weekly about the the progress.

396462,mary.bourne@showtime.net,kenneth.lay@enron.com,"Dear Ken,I thought you might enjoy this summary article on VOD from one of ourindustry magazines.  Enron is mentioned but not interviewed so I didn t knowif you would have access to a copy.Take care,Mary ElizabethLink to article:http://www.cvmag.com/contents/2000/0814/vod814.aspCut and paste:Video on the MoveDropping costs and rising competition are forcing operators to seevideo-on-demand in a whole new lightBY SIMON APPLEBAUMAt VOD programmer Diva, the deployment forecast gets more specific, as doesthe rationale behind why operators will push the action. Three factors comeinto play:* DBS penetration continues to fly and bite off operators  best customers;* the plunging expense of video-server hardware and video-streamtransmissions, which make moot the big, prohibitive load operators have usedto justify not deploying VOD;* the fallout from Time Warner s deal to merge with America Online --namely, considerable encouragement to accelerate plans in every otherconvergence direction they want to travel, be it digital cable services(including near-VOD and tiers), high-speed Web surfing through cable modems,or interactive TV.Thus with cost and infrastructure concerns put aside, and competitionstaring them in the face, operators see VOD in a new light. Now that DBSreaches 13 million subs "and is heading for 20 million, cable is feeling thepain," says Diva president David Zucker. "Every one of the eight largestcable operators, every single one, will deploy or trial VOD in some manner.The big rollouts will start the second half of the year." If they come, theymay hear another set of competitive footsteps entering the scene. Digitalsubscriber line carriers such as SBC and Qwest, hunting for high-speedInternet households, are poised to reach out and become must-see VOD TVthrough Viacom subsidiary Blockbuster. With infrastructure help from EnronBroadband Services, Blockbuster will deploy a movies-driven VOD service in anumber of cities by December, and all over the U.S. next year. The jointventure will go after cable and DBS distribution, but off the bat, DSL willbe in the driver s seat, as routed through SBC, Qwest and other suppliers.But right now, reality is nowhere near the perception Jacobsen and Zuckersuggest. Few multi-system owners have VOD formats fully deployed or intrial; most MSOs don t, even though they are deep in digital-servicelaunches incorporating near-VOD, which takes up 30 channels or more of asystem s lineup. Video-on-demand, on the other hand, uses far fewer channelsthan NVOD, because video servers, placed at or near the system s headend,store the programming and transmit it on addressable command fromsubscribers, any time, over streaming transmissions. How high is the payofffor mass cable adoption? Try 40 to 60 percent, by 2010, of the multi-billiondollar revenue pot home-video companies enjoy now, predicted Merrill Lynchsenior media analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen at the recent Myers interactive-TVforum in New York.Where the Action IsYou need more than one hand to count the number of VOD projects happeningaround the country, but you don t need many more. Here s the scorecard: * Diva - VOD s veteran packager is doing full-deployment business in atleast 10 areas. Affiliates include AT&T Broadband in Marin County, Calif.(outside San Francisco) and Atlanta (formerly MediaOne turf); CharterCommunications in the Atlanta suburbs; and a growing number of InsightCommunications locales (Columbus, Ohio; Rockford, Ill.; and Evansville,Ind.) where VOD is bundled with Source Media s Local Source interactive-TVservice. Before Labor Day, Charter will add Diva to at least one of its LosAngeles-area systems. More than 400 titles, from movie blockbusters tospecial-interest videos, are available each month. Top films go for $3.95 apop, while classic flicks and other titles get priced at $2.95 or below.Available attractions include library shows from ESPN, TNT, Discovery andother cable nets. About 15,000 subs use the service at least once a month. * Time Warner - Cable s second-largest operator is in full VOD blast,following a trial run in Austin, Texas, last summer. Honolulu became thefirst Time Warner locale to make VOD available system-wide earlier thisyear, covering about 250,000 subs. Tampa, Fla., turned on in June, accordingto Concurrent Computer, which provides servers and streaming tech to TimeWarner. About 100,000 Tampa-area subs are getting their day in the VOD sun.* Intertainer - After two years of development and tests, the VOD playerthat includes Microsoft, Comcast, NBC, Sony and Intel among its equitystakeholders will soon premiere in Comcast s suburban Baltimore system. Thatfollows DSL rollouts in U S West s Denver enterprise and Cincinnati under anindependent franchiser. The service has plenty of interactive features toaccompany the content, including opportunities to order an artist s CD afterwatching his music video; local information retrieval; and e-commercechoices. Intertainer CEO Jonathan Taplin promises a "stunning"MSO-affiliation announcement over the next few weeks.* In Demand - PPV s kingpin player was already talking to affiliates aboutVOD rollouts and trials when new president Stephen Brenner assumed his postearlier this summer (see sidebar, p. 30).* TVN - In Demand s closest PPV/NVOD rival, whose affiliate base consists ofmid-size and small system owners, is in the midst of several VOD technicaland marketing trials. Some rollout announcements are expected early thisfall. Like Diva and Intertainer, TVN wants to combine programming withinteractive applications. * DemandVideo - This California-based firm surfaced this spring, initiallyon a quest for cable overbuilder affiliates so that they wouldn t be absentfrom VOD activity. Seren Innovations (which runs its systems under AstoundCable TV) and Knology signed up before the National Cable TV Associationconvention, and Seren put Demand s format through a 25-home trial in St.Cloud, Minn. But at NCTA s show in May, Demand CEO Rajiv Juluria insistedthat his product will be available to all comers, entrenched or encroacher.Knology will launch the service among hotels in Panama City, Fla., whileSeren commits to a full St. Cloud rollout, plus deployment in Contra CostaCounty, Calif.* E-Video TV - A new VOD player out of Scottsdale, Ariz., E-Video hasdeveloped download technology through which digital cable subs can retrievefeature films, programming and interactive games. Roy Bennett, E-Video spresident, says his firm will try the process out with a cable operatorbefore summer ends.Up ahead in the player pipeline: StreamBox and AlwaysonTV.com, two venturesrunning both video and Internet content. Both exhibited two months ago atStreaming Media East in New York. Within VOD s own tech vendordom --companies that provide video servers and program-insertion gear to operators-- there s growing consensus that the on-demand era launches this fall. Howfast VOD takes off is more in the hands of set-top box providers than MSOs,believes Concurrent CEO Steve Nussrallah. The sooner they flood the scenewith digital converters, the sooner deployments happen.  "We re at the frontdoor of an explosion. Late fall or early next year is the right time forthis market to happen," he says. "The only thing holding the market back isthe ability of set-top vendors to build and ship their product at a levelequal to the demand. By the end of 2004, we should be north of 30 milliondigital set-tops, with the vast majority of them VOD-enabled. Deployment byoperators becomes a no-brainer." AOL Time Warner will push operators intodeployment decisions, adds nCube president Michael Pohl. "The convergence ofTime Warner s content with the broadband opportunities AOL looks at willdrive the content and availability of content for VOD," Pohl suggests."Movies are OK and great, probably a good place to start, but ultimately,viewers want to go to their operator and ask for whatever they want to see.""You see the operators showing excitement for VOD now, as opposed to thevendors showing excitement, which is what it was for the last few years,"says Yvette Gordon, interactive technologies VP at SeaChange Technologies."The AOL-Time Warner merger helps."The NaysayersBut many people don t buy it. Take Playboy Television -- they re supplyingproduct to selected Diva and Time Warner VOD markets. They re in the game,but Playboy TV president Jim English doesn t look for a breakout marketuntil 2002. Why? Despite big declines in server cost, "you need so many perstate, so many per [sub universe]," English reasons. "The more subs on theline, the slower the traffic goes. It s still very expensive electronics.I m not trying to poke holes at anyone, but a lot of projections about thisindustry didn t come out as advertised. How many years did it take fordigital cable to move? Even now, operators have more trucks dedicated toinstalling high-speed cable modems than digital cable. And on cable s agendapriority scale, just getting the digital box in is number one." ForSusquehanna Communications and Classic Cable, 2001 is the year VOD will makeit to their systems, provided the tech issues English raises get resolved.As big as the case is for getting economics down enough for deployment amonglarge MSOs, it s magnified several times over for owners the size ofSusquehanna and Classic.  "Insight, for example, can serve tens or hundredsof thousands of customers from a single headend. The best we can do is 7,000customers from a single headend. For the small, non-metro markets weservice, how do you amortize the cost for initial equipment installation?"asks Classic CEO Merritt Belisle. "When you take into account theflexibility and long-term viability of the tech, and different contentavenues, there s a lot that s nascent and in development," responds DanTemplain, Susquehanna s corporate marketing/programming director. "Thecontent and the tech have to become compelling enough to consumers thatwe re willing to roll it out." Still, Templain s company is determined to doa field trial somewhere this fall, and get deployment underway before theend of next March. "That s accelerated thinking from where we were sixmonths ago." To SVOD or Not to SVOD? On the programming side, the traineveryone wants to be aboard is making VOD a diverse medium, perhaps to thepoint where the medium should be relabeled "COD" -- for content-on-demand.Movies, available at or earlier than home-video release, lead the way, butnot far behind are sports, live/taped events from all over, how-to andspecial-interest videos, children s fare, games, adult entertainment and afew genres spun out of the imagination of others.  "There may belocalized-content opportunities," chirps In Demand s Jacobsen. "Localtheater, high school football games with real community value." In a CODworld, "you re not limited to video product," says TVN senior businessdevelopment VP Jim Riley. "Eventually, you download computer software so youcan view it on your TV as well as on your PC. That s where we re drivingsome of our development energies." TVN s vehicle is Chromazone, involvingCalifornia-based venture capitalist Digital Evolution. From the start,Intertainer has embraced a link of COD with interactive elements. "If MSOsmake the investment in VOD, they must maximize it with advertising,e-commerce and all sorts of interactivity," says Jonathan Taplan,Intertainer s president and CEO. "That s the ultimate promise. If you thinkabout the capital investment and the possible return in gross revenues, like$20 a sub per month, that s a damn good business." Diva, infused with $9million earlier this summer from operating system/middleware players OpenTVand Liberate Technologies (CV, 7/17/00, p. 98), now has economic backing topursue its own interactive-integration course. And soon, cable operatorswill see if their VOD future should incorporate subscriptionvideo-on-demand, or SVOD. Encore Media Group, under CEO John Sie, is bettinga substantial chunk of its future on it, and in a matter of weeks, AT&TBroadband s newly acquired Atlanta system (off the completed MediaOnemerger) will test SVOD out using Encore, Starz! and Encore s multiplexmovies. Here s the SVOD deal, as Sie explains it: Premium service subs, foran extra fee, get 20-30 titles running on that service that month on-demand,with VCR functionality. The subs watch those films whenever they want, asmany times as they want, for that one fee. Six or eight dollars a month willdo. "We re using VOD as a viewer enhancement platform," Sie insists. "Movieswill drive things first. Once they drive penetration, you can dosubscription news-on-demand and other things on-demand." Lately, Sie s SVODadvocacy comes framed inside a clarion call to move operators in thedirection of all-digital system conversion. Direct broadcast satelliteservices are that way now, and Sie believes cable system owners have twoyears at most to make that transition, contrary to the seven-to-10-yeartimeframe other industry execs predict. "You know and I know consumer demandfor digital far exceeds set-top box availability, as well as the supply ofinstallation crews. DBS realized that and now they re ramping up," Siebelieves. But opponents find two flaws in SVOD: Because the product isavailable in the premium window, six months or more after PPV availability,there may not be as much audience demand for it compared to pre-PPV.Independent of audience demand, there s the specter of cannibalization,where on-demand use comes at the expense of premium-channel viewing. "Here sa way to enhance and optimize premium services," Nussrallah concludes. "Ifyou get constant access to the programming, it s more customer-friendly, andsomething DBS can t provide. Cable is built on the concept that the audiencebuys more if they have more choice and convenience. It may be the nextopportunity window." Not so, Taplin figures. "It would be cool to get all ofThe Sopranos on a VOD package. But why would people who already see movieson premium pay for more of those same movies, after they ve had the chanceto watch those movies in an on-demand way. Unless Sie prices it so low, orunless they like those movies a lot, why would they pay again? The flat-feemodel is a great model, like cellular-phone pricing. People love paying onefee for unlimited monthly use. But the window isn t the right window." Siedefends SVOD as an enhancement option. "Would an operator launch digitalcable with pay TV only and not launch PPV, concluding that PPV cannibalizespay, or vice versa? No, because they complement each other beautifully. Samehere." Other VOD programmers and tech vendors will pursue SVOD experiments.TVN is investigating one or more affiliate partnerships for a test. Classicand Susquehanna are open to proposals. "What John says is super. What doesit cost me? I ve got a stock market and bond market to work with," Belislesays.Stream ThinkingSusquehanna exec Templain calls SVOD "a work in progress platform." Otherssay the same about streamed video content, another pot worthy of industryexploitation. "Spectacular" may be the most accurate adjective for theassortment of video Internet sites have streamed to PC householdseverywhere, from quirky animation to short films to news clips. Morediverse, longer streamed content is coming down the pike. Will the very sametech making mass VOD deployment possible now also make possible a neworiginal content pipe? What an ironic circumstance. Check in with the sitesthemselves, from Real Networks on down, and the masterminds behind thempoint to TV and cable display as their final destination. Fifty million PCs,more than 100 million TV homes, almost 70 percent of them cabled -- themarket s obvious to them. In the end, that s the ticket, cable execs concur.But for the near term, no. The broadcast quality s not there yet (althoughtech strides are happening), and there s considerable fear that producerswill use streaming to bypass cable nets. Gordon targets mid to late 2001 asthe point where streamed content will be TV/VOD-suitable. Assuming theindustry locks its fears away, nCube s Pohl sides with the crowd awaiting"this kind of ubiquitous media, where things go to the TV or PC." "We resleeping fine at night about this, because the quality is not there yet,"adds Diva s Zucker. "But we will make video streaming a Holy Grail for TV inthe next few years, and cable will be uniquely positioned to take advantageof it." * <<...>>HOME </> | CURRENT ISSUE </contents/2000/0814/> | BACK ISSUES </contents/> |DATABASE </database/> | LINKS </links/> | ABOUT US </about_cv/>  Allcontents , 2000 Cahners Business Information. <http://www.cahners.com> Allrights reserved.

As aMcKinsey alum who has watched you transform Enron from a pipeline operatorto the world s foremost energy/trading company, it is hard for me to imagineEnron without you.

Our Advisors includethe Heads of Entrepreneurship at MIT, Stanford, Harvard, CMU and Cornell.Our investors include Rajat Gupta of McKinsey, the CEO Hughes Networks andMDs from institutions such as AIG and CSFB.KnowledgeCube has just launched a $150M Energy Fund which would invest in ITcompanies that seek to enhance the productivity of the energy sector.

399854,morris@enron.com,"larimore@enron.com,jordan.larimore@lehman.com"," <<MF May 11th, 2001.pdf>>				Good Friday Morning - Comments From TheLocal Guys!Economic data so far this quarter has been extremely ambiguous. On the onehand, the employment figures released last Friday were soft, with net hiringshrinking for the second consecutive month and the unemployment rate risingto 4.5%. On the other hand, consumer sentiment has improved, and the Aprilretail sales figures were stronger than anticipated. As we have mentioned,this mixed data has increased the odds the Federal Reserve will ease by only25bp next Tuesday. At this stage, Lehman Brothers  economists still thinkthe odds favor a 50bp cut, given the underlying weakness in the economy,particularly in high-tech and manufacturing, together with the abysmalemployment data.The change in the perception on the strength of the economy can be seen inthe higher interest rates posted below.The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.87%.The 10-year yield is 5.47%.The 5-year is trading at 4.98%.Spot crude oil is trading at $28.62 p/b.Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.27 p/mcf.			AD Time:New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SECunder the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances aninsider s/employee s ability to trade his/her corporate shares duringblackout periods.Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees andinsiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase andsell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written planwas established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possessionof material, non-public information.The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account theregulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us orcall us for more information.				Lehman Brothers  Research.IMPACT CALLSEntertainment S. Linde, .212.526.4009Upfront Preview: CBS and FOX Appear Well Positioned*With the WGA negotiations all but settled, the Entertainment industry willnow turn its sights to the upfront selling cycle, whichcommences May 14 with presentations from the major Networks lasting throughMay 17.*The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market. Ad buyersmust be careful not to look at the current economicenvironment as a proxy for the future. Based on this premise, there may beupside to our 5%-10% estimated decline in upfront sales(based on 65%-70% inventory sales with low to mid single digit priceincreases).*In our opinion, VIAB and FOX are the best positioned for this year supfront given that improved ratings in the key 18-49demographic combined with our expectation for modest CPM increases willboost unit pricing.Reebok Intl Ltd(RBK) 2 - Buy R.

Thisincremental revenue should aid in 12% overall revenue growth for RBK.FOCUS STOCKSStorageNetworks, Inc(STOR) 2 - Buy H.

Lowering already-weak EPSexpectations will likely prove to be beneficial for thestock. Maintain Op outlook*Reducing our  01 EPS view from $1.50 to $1.46, now flat vs. a yr-ago & thelow on the Street*Our revision reflects adjustments to our share base & interest expenseestimates. With $1.2b in buyback targeted in  01 & $452mdone in 1Q, our previous forecast reflected more aggressive repo; mgmt isadamant that  01 buyback would not pass $1.2b. Also,higher debt levels will not likely be offset by weak currencies as much aswe thought*Imp rtantly our Op outlook albeit weak is unchanged*Maintain 1-rating. We re now confident that our  01 EPS view will not belowered anymore. With the shares at a 4+ year valuationlow & the bar on expectations very low, the risk/reward is favorableIBM Corp(IBM) 1 - Strong Buy G.

Gerstner alsocited the need for continued technological development as a way to avoidprice wars driven by commoditization of products.*Gerstner stressed IBM s commitment to high single-digit revenue growth anddouble-digit earnings growth in the future. Gerstnerindicated that the company would not simply grow revenue at any cost, butwas instead focused on EPS and cash flow driven by anoperational execution.*We maintain our current estimates and reiterate our 1-Strong Buy rating onIBM shares.IT Consulting & Computer Services K. Keirstead, .212.526.0442Gerstner s View of IT Services*Yesterdays comments from the CEO Lou Gerstner and the head of IBM GlobalServices Doug Elix represent positive long-termstatements about the IT services industry. IBM is positioning itself as aservices-lead company and claimed that the services businessis now the most important segment of the technology sector. The meetingsupports our positive view of EDS while the commentsabout the consulting and systems integration market make us incrementallymore worried about Sapient and Computer Sciences.Electronic Arts(ERTS) 3 - Market Perform F.

The co s solid performance in a difficult Qmakes it easy to believe that when hurdles are absent (i.e. an abundance ofgame consoles) they can outperform. That said, we wishthe stock were not so pricey. Due to valuation, we reiterate our marketperform.*1Q01 operating EPS of $(0.09) vs $0.08 were better than our $(0.15) est.Most of the upside came from EA Core, where in line revswere bolstered by lower op. exp. At EA.com, slightly higher revs were offsetby lower margins.*We are raising our consol. FY02E to $0.89 from $0.84 and are initiatingquarterly EPS of $(0.13), $(0.05), $0.87 and $0.20. We arealso initiating a consol. FY03E EPS of $1.71.*Adjusting for EA.com, ERTS currently trades at a forward P/E of 35.3x -higher than hist averages. Though ERTS is on the cusp ofsolid growth, this valuation indicates that it is currently in the stock.IDEC Pharmaceuticals(IDPH) 2 - Buy M.

Meanwhile, aides said Gov. Gray Davis will consider paying businesses to run heavily polluting diesel generators to boost the state s power supply and help avert rolling blackouts.  Reliant Energy said it could chop its power bids from the high of $1,900 per megawatt hour Davis criticized this month to as little as $150 per megawatt hour -- but only if air regulators quickly allow it to exceed pollution standards at the three plants.  The Houston-based generator will cut its prices immediately, but will soon be forced to shut down three of its five Southern California plants for the rest of the year if pollution standards aren t lifted, said Joe Bob Perkins, president and CEO of Reliant Energy Wholesale Group.  Davis singled out Reliant s $1,900-per-megawatt-hour charge earlier this month as an example of the egregious prices he said generators should voluntarily cut.  Reliant said it deliberately bid the high price to discourage the state s power grid operator from calling its high-polluting plants into use. Using the plants now eats up valuable pollution credits that will likely be needed to keep the plants running during even higher demand periods this summer, the company said.  "In essence, we are doing exactly what Gov. Gray Davis has suggested. But if these restrictions are not lowered, we will run out of power from these units very quickly," Perkins said in a statement.  Perkins proposed that emissions hours not be counted against Reliant s yearly allotment whenever the plants are called into operation to help prevent blackouts.  Reliant s Mandalay, Etiwanda and Ellwood plants each face annual air pollution limits imposed by the South Coast Air Quality Management District and the Santa Barbara County and Ventura County air pollution control districts. Reliant has asked for extensions from each of the districts.  "There s no question we are in an emergency situation. We will consider every option available" to avert blackouts, said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. But he said the administration had not seen Reliant s proposal.  Davis also will consider paying businesses to fire up their backup generators when necessary to avoid outages, Salazar said. Running the generators would let the businesses disconnect from the state s power grid, freeing up electricity for other uses.  The proposals have consumer and environmental groups outraged.  "It s a short-term fix that will have potential long-term health consequences," said Paul Knepprath of the American Lung Association of California.  The state should instead cut demand by encouraging more conservation, the lung association and 18 other consumer and environmental groups said in a letter to Davis on Wednesday.  Davis already is promoting conservation, but blackouts have health and public safety consequences too, Salazar said. The use of backup generators is being proposed by the administration s top energy advisers, but Davis has not yet seen the proposal, Salazar said.  The governor is willing to "explore every conceivable option for generation this summer," Salazar said.  The twin developments come the same week the administration cut by 20 percent its estimate of new power generation that will be available this summer. Davis now projects 4,000 additional megawatts, 1,000 megawatts short of his original estimate. A megawatt is enough power for about 750 homes.

However, according to my counterpart over at BPA (BPA trading attorney Gerit Hull), BPA is disputing that it is subject to the price mitigation requirements of FERC s June 19th Order.  Apparently, BPA s argument is that it is not subject to the price caps because it is "non-jurisdictional."  (BPA will have to do better than this, because the "non-jurisdictional" argument simply begs the question, because it says "you don t have jurisdiction over us because, well, you don t have jurisdiction over us.")  BPA sees the FERC Order as a "political" move to take away BPA s independence, and is now sending additional reinforcements to the FERC settlement in Washington D.C."
