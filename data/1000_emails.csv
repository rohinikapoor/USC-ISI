kevin.hyatt@enron.com,harvey.harmon@elpaso.com,"hi harvey -- as we discussed , i m chairman of the natural gas infrastructure subcommittee for the electric power 2002 conference . the conference will be held in st. louis , mo march 19-21 , 2002 . website is www . electricpowerexpo . com/ep2002/cfp . html . primary attendees are electric power plant developers , builders , operators , and equipment suppliers . one of our proposed speaking topics is "" lng - a new role in north american supply . "" a concern among power generators has been the lack of domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing gas-fired electric generation needs . the committee feels lng can and will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future . i m looking for an lng expert who would be willing to give a 15-30 minute presentation on the morning of march 20 , 2002 , 10 - 11:30 am . they would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in a q & a session afterward . after you visit the website , if could let me know if you are interested in speaking , i will have a formal invitation forwarded to you . thanks for the help!kevin hyatt713-853-5559kevin . hyatt@enron . com"

"" we were hoping for something less punitive , something that would encourage interstate pipeline construction , but this is more punitive . this will prevent any further investment in infrastructure , "" said chadd jones , spokesperson for questar , which has an oil pipeline conversion project ready to go at the border . jones said questar , which has already started to convert a 16-inch oil line to natural gas outside california s border , is hoping the full cpuc will take a closer look and make some changes to the judge s decision . otherwise , the converted southern trails line will have to stop at the border due to lack of customers . if the new peaking service is approved as it stands , customers of an interstate line into the state , instead of paying the rls charge for back-up service supplied by the utility , would pay the even more onerous peaking charge . the peaking charge , added onto the charges paid for space on the interstate , makes the choice of interstate transportation prohibitive . jones said the southern trails line is fully subscribed from the four corners area to the border , but "" no one is willing to take service on the in-state portion of the line to long beach , for fear of having to pay peaking rates . "" customers have been interested , but the potential cost is prohibitive . "" it s the reason no interstate pipelines have been built into socal gas territory , "" jones said . he noted that pacific gas & electric has no back-up service charge . the only interstate to penetrate california s borders , kern river pipeline , delivers to bakersfield , which is outside the socal gas system . jones said the back-up service rate is more punitive than questar has seen anywhere else . "" usually , if there is a peaking charge , it is based on the whole system s needs on a peak day . this is based on a single customer s peak day . it makes the rate exorbitant . "" besides the southern trails project , several other proposed new interstate pipelines could be affected if the peaking service makes them uneconomic . meanwhile , the california energy commission has cited the lack of in-state pipeline capacity as the major reason for natural gas price spikes at the southern california border ( see daily gpi , june 5 <d20010605i. html> ) ."

jmhorne@us.ibm.com,martin.deb@enron.com,"i would like to offer a different perspective on the attacks that occurredlast tuesday . it s view of the forest that i don t think the press has notgotten to in it s coverage so far . the american reaction to this has been healthy and accurate . after readingbooks on normandy , iwo jima , i always wondered if the us still possessed afire in it s belly to stoke if someone should ever deliver a blow likethis . so far so good , but can it be sustained to go the distance ? while themedia focuses on the personal tragedy and how to cope with what has happen , maybe we should get in touch with our courage as well as our emotions todeal with what may happen . in my opinion is that the us has been provoked into a larger scheme . whoever did this not only expects the us to launch counter attacks , theyare betting on it . and they are betting that the us won t go it alone . theyare betting that western intervention in the mid east will destabilize theregion , possibly the world , and that will ultimately bring the demise ofisrael . that is what these fanatics are ultimately after . as you know , we ve fought in the mid east before , but this time it will bedifferent in many ways . if the west opts for a militarily engagement ( and iwould be shocked if they didn t ) they will not have the coalition they didfor the gulf war . many of the arab countries that were on board duringdesert storm will not be able to internally support western counter attacksthat will be frequent , massive and multinational . of course we should expect that these terrorist factions to volley theirown counter attacks back against the us . retaliatory strikes from terroristmay not be as spectacular as what happened last tuesday , but they will bejust as ugly . they have many unspeakable options . the terrorists that perpetrated the attacks on tuesday , have calculatedthat we , the american people , can not stomach a long , drawn out , ugly , conflict . sadam hussein made this assumption in the past and it was theoverwhelming support from the american people that ultimately gave us thestrength to exact our mission and bring our troops home so soon ( your trulyincluded ) . but the gulf war was neither long or drawn out . a campaign through themountains of persia probably will be long , difficult and ugly . if yourecall this region was the labeled the russian vietnam . i think theperpetrators have already assumed that american , public support willdissolve quickly for a conflict with two fronts . the main front in thesouthwest asia and a domestic front that will feature psychological andphysical violence that american has never had to deal with before . reallythink about that and ask yourself have they calculated correctly ? ipersonally think they have made a grave error . america may have a brokennose , but it s arms , legs , and spirit stand ready and waiting . i offer these opinions to get folks thinking and preparing for what mighthappen next . and if it does , we have to examine our reaction and resolvenow . the war that the president says that we are now in will surely lastlonger than the hundred day gulf war . i think it will probably take yearswith uncomfortable lulls between attacks and skirmishes . and a final point . i can definitely understand why americans would want topostpone regular activities out of respect for the americans that losttheir lives . it s a natural , reactive response . what most people don tunderstand however is that you do not let terrorist dictate what you do . when that happens , you living your life by their rules . may i suggest aproactive response . return to normal life as closely as you can . that isthe best , immediate , defiant message we can send back to them . the first ofmany ... um ... messages , we will be sending them . mike"

a man behind the scenes e power , a power generation company , which is jointly funded by enron , a u. s. energy giant , and orix , was dissolved for all intents and purposes on the 17th of this month . on this day , 40 people , including mr. carey sloan ( chairman ) and mr. tatsuro seguchi ( president ) left e power , and mr. j o day ( sic ) , who used to be the vice president of enron japan , assumed the office of president and ceo of e power . at the same time , e power s office was moved from a building in shinjyuku , tokyo to within enron japan s office located in the first square building in otemachi , tokyo . rumors are starting to spread amongst people in the industry that the two companies will merge together in the near future . according to a source in a trading company , the recent mass departure from e power took place , because enron corp , which was irritated by e power s poor business results , fired everyone who were related to the company s generation department . moreover , all of the company s power plant siting projects , except for a project in ube , yamaguchi prefecture , will apparently be brought back to square one . it is looking likely that the company s large-scale gas-fired power plant project in rokkashomura , aomori prefecture , which drew the attention of the energy industry , will be killed off even before a piece of land was obtained for the project . the greatest cause of the company s downfall was that it was unable to show any clear business strategy . at the time of foundation , the company was intending to conduct mainly trading and intermediation of electricity . however , the company changed its objective to siting its own power plants because it realized that securing of surplus electricity was difficult . furthermore , because acquisition of land had not been going well for the company , the company , until recently , had been considering energy-saving service ( esco ) as a stopgap measure until a power plant could be constructed . so far , the company has not been able to conduct any business that produced a cash flow . in other words , the company has been operating with a loss ever since its establishment . it is hardly possible for enron , which is avaricious when it comes to pursuing cost-effectiveness , to leave this situation as it is . one could say that e power has done well to have held out this long . another cause - a hidden cause - of e power s downfall was surely the fact that the company held up high a flag that showed the five-letter word "" enron "" . a few years ago , a person related to a certain ipp turned down an offer from e power to purchase its surplus energy saying that "" although he wouldn t mind selling power to e power , he had not intention of selling any power to enron "" . it may have been a mistake for e power , which was established mainly around electricity business specialists from trading companies , such as marubeni , to have joined hands with enron , which is particularly good at using business methods that would not be accepted in japan . news behind the scenes another article ( title not available ) before i was able to overcome the astonishment that i felt regarding the terrorist attacks in the united states , a major massacre took place on the following monday on the 17th at epower , an affiliated company of a major energy trading company in the united states , enron corp . i had thought that a major restructuring would take place soon or later , but the extent of which made me realize just how dry an american company could be . it has been almost two years since epower was established , and for some employees , including executives , the term of contract was about to end . in that sense , it is not surprising that things happened . in any case , all epower employees - numbering close to 50 - were called into the office by e-mail on the 17th , and 35 people were told there and then that they were fired . quite amazing . epower s office was moved immediately to where enron japan s office is located in the first square building in otemachi , chiyoda-ku , from shinjyuku center building in nishi-shinjyuku , shinjyuky-ku , tokyo . the efficient way in which everything was executed was like a well-planned coup d etat . you could say that an enron cruise missile has made a direct hit on epower . as i described above , epower was established two years ago under the auspices of enron corp as the standard-bearer of electricity liberalization . at one stage , the company sent shockwaves through the electricity industry being compared to the black ships that came to japan at the end of tokugawa shogunate regime . however , despite the company s promising start , the company seems to be heading towards an anticlimax . it is of most people s opinion that the company s capital subscriber , enron corp , will abandon the company in the end , dissolving the company as soon as the remaining businesses are cleared up . among the 35 people fired from epower , i hear that there is someone who joined the company in april this year . there certainly was a problem with epower s management increasing the number of staff without making much of a business progress . however , i question highly the way in which enron carried out dismissal en masse . enron probably would argue its case by saying that people have no right to complain because the company had observed applicable laws and contracts . however , laws and contracts are only minimal obligations . it seems that the company has no recognition of the fact that a higher-level consideration is necessary for people with different cultures to work together . not unlike the us government which does not recognize that one of the major reasons for the recent terrorist attacks on the united states was due to the shortcomings in its middle east - islam policy , enron too does not understand the key elements in doing business in japan . news behind the scenes : september 12a black ship named "" enron "" runs aground in japanese watersmr . z - a man behind the scenes enron may pull out of the japanese market in the near future - this is the opinion that is beginning to spread amongst people related to the energy industry in japan . the reason for this is that both "" epower "" , an electricity retailing company jointly funded by enron and orix corp. , and "" enron japan "" , a fully-owned energy trading company of enron , are being forced to fight a desperate battle in the japanese market . in particular , the way epower is running about in confusion stands out quite conspicuously . the company , when founded in 1999 , looked to conduct electricity intermediation business , but has been having a hard time trying to launch the business because of significant barriers in the liberalized electricity market . in spite of the fact that the company has changed its strategy to building its own power plants in various places , such as omuta in fukuoka , ube in yamaguchi , rokkashomura in aomori , etc. , the company is still having a difficult time trying to obtain the necessary sites . within such an environment , the company s ceo , mr. bruce wrobel , left epower in february this year because his plans for the company differed from that of enron corp s. then in august , mr. hiroo awano , who has been quite active in visible scenes , such as dealing with the media as a deputy representative and the spokesman for the company , was suddenly fired . it seems that he was made responsible for the company s poor performances . there is also information floating around that "" epower has been examining the possibility of conducting energy-saving service business in cooperation with large electrical appliance manufacturers , automobile manufacturers , general construction companies , etc. , until its electricity retailing business gets going . "" it is unclear whether this is a present progressive development or not . however , it is possible to catch a glimpse of the company s impatience as it strives to "" achieve whatever result possible "" . meanwhile , there is a rumor that enron japan will carry out a major corporate restructuring . amalgamation with epower could also be a possibility . the u. s. government and ustr are making multitude of demands to the ministry of economy , trade and industry through u. s.-japan deregulation conference so that they could somehow make enron s advances into the japanese market a success . however , it seems that enron s solidarity with politics is producing a result opposite to what was intended . could a black ship named "" enron , "" which has run aground in the japanese waters , go to the bottom after all before too long ?"

( not 100 sq. cm . sample ) 2 . a composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator at the selexol plant . the filters appeared to be exceptionally clean 3 . composite sample of the fine powdery rust which had collected in the bottom of the f/s . approximte volume one cup . 4 . composite sample of the used filters from the f/s . visible appearance of the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and virtually unstained . a small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the f/s . 5 . a sample of an unused clean stocked filter . this was a control sample . on the pg & e side : 1 . a liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the topock filter separator prior to deconning . approx . volume one cup 2 . sample of the solids ( fine , blackened , powder ) which had collected in the f/s . an estimate of the volume of this material removed form the f/s prior to deconning was approximately one gallon . 3 . wipe samples ( 3 ) of the interrior of the f/s prior to deconning ( not 100 cm sq. wipe ) 4 . used filter media from the f/s . the operation of the f/s filters are designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter . composite samples were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters . 5 . wipes ( 3 ) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls . the only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process was the volume and buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material which was present in the f/s at the topock c/s and conspicuously small amount of rust colored material which was present in transwestern s f/s . as previously mentioned , samples were collected of both materials . the only difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the volume . it is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in august of 99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had over time moved and collected in the pg & e f/s . the small amount of rust materials observed in the transwestern f/s is the result of the pigging activity from the selexol plant into the transwestern f/s . i will have reprensentataive samples of both materials . photographs were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in flagstaff with pg & e. on the 13th of july . analytical results will also be completed at this time ."

forced ranking sets up a totem pole . everyone has a place on that pole , from the top to the bottom . and the pole gets chopped off from the bottom . about 20 percent of american companies use forced ranking , according to an article on the subject in the harvard management update , a newsletter from the publishing arm of the business school . some companies used forced ranking only for top managers . others use the system for all managers , or all exempt employees who are not on hourly wages . some of the most admired companies use the process -- general electric , for example . here in houston , enron uses a five-point scale with 15 percent in the bottom ranking . proponents of forced ranking say it makes managers confront a perennial problem : that of low-performing managers and employees . not only do the low performers cause problems now . if they neither improve nor leave , they block promotion for people who might do a better job . productivity and morale sag . fewer top people want to join the company . the best performers leave . in what seems to be the endless american cycle of hiring and layoffs , forced ranking also gives managers some objective criteria to use when it s once again time to let people go . but forced ranking also can raise the usual cries of discrimination that any ranking system brings . at microsoft , an african-american plaintiff sued , claiming his low ranking came because of his race . at ford motor co. , which has dropped forced ranking , the charges of discrimination came from middle-aged white males . forced ranking has provided a much-needed boost at some companies -- ones that have not confronted performance problems of managers over the years . still , after a few cycles of forced ranking , companies must decide what s next . so you ve weeded out the slackers . you ve helped those who needed help to improve their performance . overall , the company is doing a much better job of getting the products or services out the door . inevitably , companies will reach a point of diminishing returns . if every manager or exempt employee is at least competent at his or her job , is it really worth it to rate and arbitrarily fire 10 percent or so of them every year ? sure , that s going to keep everyone on their toes as they scramble to keep their jobs . but it may not be all that good in encouraging teamwork . and , as france s army found in world war i , the practice of decimation -- arbitrarily shooting 10 percent of your own troops to encourage the others to fight harder -- does not tend to raise morale . forced ranking also seems to me to be based on the wrong premise -- that is , that companies need to be filled with high-performance people from top to bottom to succeed . that may not necessarily be true . every organization really needs a mix of people . for example , organizations need a leavening of malcontents . they stir up things , get people thinking , challenge assumptions . yet an organization composed of nothing but malcontents won t work . sure , every company needs top performers . they are the yeast that causes the organization to rise . but companies also need the steady and the sturdy and people with limited imagination to take care of the millions of details that must be faced every day . it s the equivalent of taking out the trash . it s not inspiring work , but unless it gets done , it gets smelly . comments ?

"" the promoters of greenfield shipping company , however , rejected the proposal ab initio , "" sources familiar with the developments told business line . the bailout proposal was made by the german agency during discussions held in london recently between the representatives of the three promoters ( mitsui o. s. k. lines , sci and atlantic commercial inc ) and the lending consortium led by anz investment bank . as per the offer , the kg finance group would facilitate the completion of the 137,000-cubic-metre capacity tanker to be used for transporting lng from oman to enron s power plant at dabhol . the lng carrier would be converted into a german asset by bringing it under a special purpose vehicle ( spv ) registered in germany . the tanker would be operated by german crew . the greenfield shipping company is registered in the cayman islands and would fly a maltese flag . the german entity had also proposed to tie up finances for the entire arrangement through a mix of public and private funding . kg finance group was of the view that the greenfield shipping company had paid an "" unbelievably higher price "" for the lng tanker by contracting it a rate of $ 220 million . in its reckoning , the vessel building price was at least $ 15 to 20 million higher than the market price prevailing then . against this backdrop , kg finance group had told the representatives of the greenfield shipping company assembled in london that the tanker would fetch not more than $ 65,000 per day as charter hire rates , the sources said . this was against the charter hire rate of $ 98,600 per day agreed with dabhol power company . the german agency had also said that it would charge a commission of 3 per cent for finalising the deal . the proposal was turned down by the promoters of greenfield shipping company on the grounds that transferring the asset from a maltese flag to a german flag would deprive the tanker of depreciation benefits . "" besides , the project will not break even at a charter hire rate of $ 65,000 per day , "" the sources said . the offer made by kg finance group comes in the wake of a crisis facing the promoters of the lng shipping project after the lenders suspended the last tranche of the project loan of $ 55 million , citing an event of default . the project promoters will not be able to take possession of the lng carrier if the remaining project cost of $ 55 million is not paid to the shipbuilding yard . the crisis has been compounded by the fact that enron is planning to exit from the project by selling its 20 per cent stake in the venture . while various permutations and combinations have been discussed between the joint venture partners , nothing has taken a concrete shape so far , dragging the venture into deeper uncertainty . while making its offer , the german entity had drawn attention to the not-so-rosy lng market globally . the lng vessel prices are now ruling at about $ 165 million . "" besides , about 24 lng vessels are lying idle world - over . even two new vessels delivered recently are lying idle without any commitment to charter , "" the sources said , pointing to the bleak scenario prevailing at the moment which has steeply driven down the charter hire rates for lng ships . p. manojcopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . cm rejects ncp plea for probe into enron dispute10/11/2001the times of indiacopyright ( c ) 2001 the times of india ; source : world reporter ( tm ) mumbai : maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has rejected a demand by the nationalist congress party ( ncp ) for reconsideration of a judicial probe being set up into the enron controversy . mr deshmukh told a press conference here on wednesday , `` as far as we are concerned , the issue of a judicial probe into enron is over . deputy chief minister chhagan bhujbal , sitting adjacent to him , kept mum when mr deshmukh s attention was drawn to the demand by the ncp , the principal partner of the ruling democratic front . ncp president sharad pawar had stated at a public meeting last week that his party would not be responsible if the state had to pay arbitration costs to enron running into hundreds of crores of rupees . similarly , ncp spokesman vasant chavan had alleged that the decision to institute the judicial probe needed to be reconsidered . mr deshmukh s outright rejection of the demand could be another reason for tension between the congress and the ncp , sources said . hiking of water supply charges by the df government is another major issue that has been hanging fire . maharashtra pradesh congress committee president govindrao adik and other leaders had attacked the government s decision to the hike . when mr deshmukh was asked to state the government s response , he announced that the matter would be referred to the df coordination committee . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . former enron broadband services asia ceo joins droplets board2001-10-11 08:30 ( new york ) former enron broadband services asia ceo joins droplets advisoryboardsanjay bhatnagar brings extensive international and infrastructureexperiencenew york , ny -- ( internet wire ) -- 10/11/01 -- droplets , a leadinginternet software platform and solutions company , today announced theappointment of sanjay bhatnagar to its board of advisors . he joinscurrent and former technology and management authorities from at & t ( nyse : t ) , hanseatic corp. , mckinsey & co. and philips consumerelectronics ( nyse : phg ) . as ceo of enron broadband services ( nyse : ene ) for the middle east andasia , bhatnagar was responsible for developing enron stelecommunication businesses in the region , including bandwidthtrading , optical fiber networks , internet data centers and theon-demand video and entertainment businesses .

( aep ) outlined the utility s growth objectives in a conference with financial analysts wednesday , emphasizing its plan to lean on wholesale operations for future growth . aep also noted how a planned corporate separation plan , expected to wrap up by the end of 2001 pending regulatory approval , will help by separating and clearly defining the company s unregulated operations . "" that is clearly going to be the major growth driver for aep , "" said henry fayne , executive vice president at aep and the newly-named head of the company s regulated operations . fayne is also the outgoing chief financial officer at aep . aep officials said the company is targeting 8 % earnings per share growth on a year-to-year basis for an undefined period . because regulated utility operations are typically a slow-growth business , aep expects wholesale operations to increase their contribution to earnings by at least 10 % each year going forward . on a shorter term basis , fayne reiterated aep s guidance for 2001 earnings in the $ 3.50 to $ 3.60 a diluted share range . a poll of 12 analysts by thomson financial/first call , by comparison , shows the company earning $ 3.59 a diluted share for the year . aep also maintained its 2002 earnings guidance , though it said a planned power plant acquisition announced this week should boost results by at least six cents . the company said monday that it plans to buy two 2,000 megawatt coal-fired power plants in the u. k. from edison international s ( eix ) edison mission energy unit for $ 960 million . with that deal , 2002 earnings should fall into the $ 3.80 to $ 3.90 a diluted share range , fayne said . a thomson financial/first call poll of 13 analysts puts 2002 earnings at $ 3.88 a diluted share . to achieve its longer term targets , aep plans to lean heavily on its expanding wholesale trading operations . currently , the company is the second largest wholesale electricity trader in the u. s. after enron corp. ( ene ) , and it ranks in the top ten in natural gas trading . the company expects to become a top-five natural gas trader as early as the fourth quarter this year , and to continue expanding electricity trading as the market evolves . and the company s aggressive growth plans shouldn t be deterred by current weakness in natural gas prices , or by wholesale power prices that are barely above generation costs in key u. s. markets , said eric van der walde , executive vice president of marketing and trading at aep . the company continues to move into new markets and to use sophisticated analysis to devise market strategies , and because it isn t simply trying to sell electricity above cost , it isn t held back by sluggish markets , van der walde said . "" it s not negative for us to have markets where the prices are declining , "" he said . fayne also noted that the performance at aep s fleet continues to improve , which effectively adds more megawatts to its portfolio . power plants in the company s eastern midwest base , where it operates nearly 24,000 megawatts of power , ran at 91.8 % capacity in 2001 , up from 87.6 % capacity a year ago . the company expects continued improvement for 2001 . aside from the u. k. power plant acquisition plan announced this week , aep said it remains open to other future power plant purchases . though the company doesn t believe it needs to always own power plants in areas where it markets power , like the west coast , owning assets in those areas can still be helpful , said e. linn draper , aep s president and chief executive . "" we would be open to the idea of trading something here for something somewhere else , "" draper said . "" nothing is sacred in terms of the portfolio . anything is fair game . "" the company does plan in the near term to hold on to its large cook nuclear plant , a 2,110-megawatt generator in michigan that regained full operations at the beginning of 2001 after a three-year outage , draper said . but because there has been so much consolidation in the nuclear power industry , the company is open to considering some method of outside management that might allow it to share resources with other nuclear utilities . - by jon kamp , dow jones newswires ; 312-750-4129 ; jon . kamp@dowjones . comcopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved ."

"" in short , the government got virtually nothing from this legalmonstrosity of a lawsuit , which is precisely what it deserves , "" armentano writes . "" microsoft , on the other hand , is a clear anddecisive winner on the issue that first sparked the lawsuit : thetying of its web browser to its operating system . "" like the antitrust prosecution of ibm in the 1970s and early 80s , the microsoft antitrust case was without merit , and illustrate theneed to fundamentally reform or repeal antitrust policies , accordingto armentano . "" antitrust has a long and sorry history of prosecuting aggressivelycompetitive companies that have innovated rapidly and lowered pricesto consumers . and most antitrust remedies attempt to restrain ( price ) competition -- witness the provision in the microsoftsettlement that requires published rates and uniform discounts -- ormake it easier for less efficient firms to do more business .

"" there appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved , "" barone said . the writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company s operations went some way to appeasing wall street after a tumultuous year in which enron s stock lost about two-thirds of its value , but analysts said they were not about to let enron off the hook just yet . bear stearns analyst robert winters said he remained concerned about enron s quality of earnings and cash flow . winters said he believed enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns , but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk , which could adversely affect some of the company s financing arrangements . "" problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain , particularly overseas , "" he said . one such asset is enron s 65 percent stake , valued at $ 1 billion , in the dabhol power plant project in india , which has been stalled because of a long-running payments dispute with its only customer , a local utility company . enron s stock closed down $ 1.64 , or 4.85 percent , at $ 32.20 on wednesday . for the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent , underperforming the standard & poor s utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period . enron was a wall street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent , driven by enthusiasm for the company s broadband plans and the success of its enrononline internet energy and commodity trading platform . but the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured , new chief executive jeff skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the dabhol power plant project . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . usa : update 1-rto seen key to boosting new england power supply . by scott disavino10/17/2001reuters english news service ( c ) reuters limited 2001 . new york , oct 17 ( reuters ) - energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the u. s. northeast hinges , in part , on setting up a northeast regional transmission organization ( rto ) . rtos are predominantly for-profit groups established to bring all of a region s high-voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid . the federal energy regulatory commission ( ferc ) , which oversees the interstate wholesale power market , believes rtos will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers , in turn improving service and driving down rates . "" if ferc can drive the northeast rto to closure in a reasonable period of time , it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation , "" enron corp. s managing director of global government affairs , rick shapiro , told reuters . houston-based enron is the nation s top energy marketer . "" how and when the rto gets implemented will radically impact the market . it s crucial to the development of the market in new england , "" mirant corp. spokesman ray long told reuters . energy provider mirant , of atlanta , has 1,400 megawatts ( mw ) of generation in new england . the company is currently adding another 700 mw to its canal station in massachusetts . "" once we get the permits for canal , we will reassess whether to proceed with the project . a big part of that assessment will depend on the rto process , "" long said . the northeast rto ferc wants to see four super-regional rtos created in the u. s. - in the northeast , midwest , southeast and west . several regions have taken long strides toward developing rtos , including a not-for-profit model proposed in the midwest and rival for-profit plans vying for ferc approval in the west . ferc chairman patrick wood , seeking to spur the development of rtos , favors giving utilities until dec. 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market , though the commission has not voted on this plan . the northeast rto will include new england , new york , the pennsylvania-new jersey-maryland ( pjm ) region and possibly parts of eastern canada . ferc said it wants the northeast rto to be built on the pjm market platform and to include the best practices of the new england and new york markets . pjm interconnection , which operates the power grid in parts of pennsylvania , new jersey , maryland , delaware , virginia and washington , d. c. , is the nation s only fully functioning rto . "" the process ferc set in place to establish one rto in pjm , new york and new england is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market , "" long said . long said mirant determined a single northeast rto would save more than $ 440 million annually by eliminating the "" artificial borders that now exist between new york , new england and pjm . "" an administrative law judge , acting as a mediator for ferc , considered three proposals for creating the northeast rto . the three plans were proposed by interested parties , including mirant and enron , and the region s grid operators - the new york independent system operator ( iso ) in new york , iso new england in new england and pjm . last month , the judge asked the ferc to decide who will govern the northeast rto and what the timetable is to put the plan in place . the judge favored a plan put forward by the new york iso and iso new england . "" if ferc implements the rto plan proposed by pjm in 2003 , consumers could save $ 1.5 billion ... $ 440 million a year ... over the new york/new england plan , which would not be implemented until 2006 , "" long said . under the pjm plan , pjm would overlay its current market model across the entire region , while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets . "" although nothing is perfect , pjm is widely accepted as the best market in the region . new york and new england , which are younger markets , are still works in progress with some bugs to work out , "" enron s shapiro said . copyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . enron seeks replacement for aga s gas storage report10/17/2001dow jones energy service ( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc. ) houston - ( dow jones ) - enron corp. ( ene ) , the nation s largest natural gas trading company , isn t ready to let the regular report on u. s. natural gas storage inventory die , a company executive said tuesday . because the american gas association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year , enron would like to see another organization take over the report , said john lavorato , president and chief executive of the company s americas wholesale services unit . speaking at a meeting with analysts , lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals . without a regular report on storage gas inventory , the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past , he said . the department of energy s energy information administration publishes monthly data on gas storage , but the information isn t as timely as data the aga reports each wednesday . the eia issued its latest gas storage report oct. 9 . it showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of july . the data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities . it also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of august and september . those estimates are generated by a computer model . wednesday s weekly storage report from the aga will show estimated inventory as of oct. 12 . the aga estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities . that data is then run through an aga computer model to generate the report . lavorato said he would like to see the eia , the interstate natural gas association of america or consultants like pira energy group , an international energy consulting firm , take over reports on storage inventory . ingaa is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the u. s. , canada and mexico . they manage many of the gas storage facilities . lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited , he said . he said he thinks the aga has found itself "" in the middle of something it didn t want to be in . "" originally intended for use within the gas industry , the weekly aga report has become high-profile , and is even watched by equity markets , he said . some industry participants have criticized the aga report , wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the aga . many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures . when the aga has revised storage figures from previous reports , gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly . - by michael rieke , dow jones newswires ; 713-547-9207 ; michael . rieke@dowjones . comcopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company

17 ( bloomberg ) -- president george w. bushwill nominate joseph kelliher , a policy adviser to u. s. energysecretary spencer abraham , to fill the open seat on the federalenergy regulatory commission , the white house said . if the senate approves kelliher , a former republican counselfor the house energy and commerce committee , the commission willhave its full five members for the first time since pat wood , bush s first ferc appointee , became chairman sept. 1 . `` i hope they speed him through the process , saidcommissioner nora brownell , a republican who was appointed by bushearlier this year . `` he is a thoughtful person who knows how towork through issues . kelliher s nomination comes as the commission has pledged toclosely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity andnatural gas markets and promote competition . in the next month orso , it is due to choose which groups will run the electric powergrid around the country , an important step in deregulating thenation s power markets . a former power industry lobbyist , kelliher would fill theopening left by the departure of curt hebert , a republicanappointed by president bill clinton and named chairman by bush . hebert left the commission aug. 31 to join entergy corp. after thewhite house made it clear bush planned to make wood the chairman . with kelliher , ferc will have three republicans and two democrats . `` kelliher will be a valuable final addition to the team nowworking actively to finish the transition to truly competitive anddynamic power markets , said the electric power supplyassociation , which represents competitive power sellers such asenron corp . the commission is responsible for ensuring fair wholesaleelectricity and natural gas prices . energy regulators may loosen price caps on western power sales2001-10-17 14:59 ( new york ) energy regulators may loosen price caps on western power sales washington , oct. 17 ( bloomberg ) -- federal regulators areconsidering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity incalifornia and 10 western states , which power producers hope willallow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight . the federal energy regulatory commission plans a publicconference oct. 29 to discuss altering the pricing formula . thecommission established caps in april and june , after skyrocketingelectricity costs led to insolvency for california s largestutilities , units of pg & e corp. and edison international . `` we have heard and understand that people do think thesolution was very california-centric , and it was , ferc chairmanpat wood said , indicating changes in the formula are likely . `` butcalifornia s needs were very urgent at the time . while commissioners declined to say what they would bewilling to change about the pricing formula , they want to fine-tune the caps before the winter , which is the peak period ofdemand and may yet cause another jump in prices , wood said . changes could be made next month . the current pricing formula is based on the most-expensivepower generated in california . enron corp. , sierra pacificresources and other sellers of power to california want theformula to consider costs from all generators in the region . enron blamed the formula for a july 2 blackout in nevada , when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too lowbased on the highest cost of supply then being offered incalifornia . lower power costs though the cost of wholesale power in california has droppedsince the commission ordered the first emergency cap on april 25 , wood said the western states may face another shortage of powerand high prices this winter . the pacific northwest depends on hydropower for much of itsenergy needs , and rainfall has been below normal this year . partof the shortfall in power last year and early this year was theresult of a drought that reduced power available from dams . `` i remain concerned about that part of the country , woodsaid . `` it has not been raining a whole lot out there . the average price for a megawatt-hour at the california-oregon border in september was $ 24.91 , down from $ 313.70 in april . a megawatt-hour is enough electricity to power about 750 averagecalifornia homes for an hour . on the agenda for this month s conference is a proposal tolink the formula to the price of natural gas , a fuel used in manygenerating plants . `` i m not predisposed for or against specific changes , saidferc commissioner nora brownell . the oct. 29 conference will helpthe commission determine aspects of the price control that theparties involved agree are working and those that are not , shesaid . surcharge in a related matter , the commission also may halt the 10percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in california tocover the costs of collecting bad debt . the insolvent californiautilities now have plans to pay off their debts . for power sellers in the west , the current price caps oftenrequire utilities to sell their excess power at a loss , enron , sierra pacific and other marketers said in statements to thecommission . they said the price they sometimes pay for power ishigher than the cost of supply from the most-expensive producer incalifornia . `` the determination of the proxy price should not be limitedto california generators , enron said in a government filing . itshould be `` determined by the least-efficient generator in theentire west . power marketers also should be allowed to recover `` justifiable costs above the proxy prices , enron wrote . california officials had demanded the price controls afterpg & e s pacific gas & electric and edison s southern californiaedison racked up more than $ 14 billion in power-buying losses . the caps were extended to other western states -- oregon , washington , arizona , nevada , wyoming , new mexico , colorado , montana , idaho and utah -- in june because some said generators inthe west could simply get around the cap by selling outsidecalifornia when prices were higher elsewhere . the caps don texpire until sept. 30 , 2002 , though they can be changed . california said before the price cap was extended to otherstates that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboringstates at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoidblackouts . on july 2 , sierra pacific cut supplies to 10,000 customersfor 45 minutes when temperatures soared and three power plantswere idled . it couldn t buy 50 megawatts of power in the spotmarket , partly because of suppliers concerns with the federalcap , company spokesman paul heagan said at the time . enron faces questions over limited partnerships , wsj reports2001-10-17 10:11 ( new york ) houston , oct. 17 ( bloomberg ) --

( in dollar terms , the liability to the fully-vested beneficiaries had increased by approximately $ 1.4 million . ) in earlier notices we cautioned that the estimated benefits were subject to change based upon corrections to the participant database statistics . during the review process there were substantial corrections required . a detailed explanation of the corrected liability amounts will be presented to the board . if anyone would like to discuss their situation with me personally , i can be reached at ext. 8-2285 . __________________________________________________ please click on the link below to indicate you have received thisemail .

"" where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who would not is still subject to negotiation . the size of the dedicated rate component is also subject to negotiation . socal has suggested $ 3m for 10 to 12 years . note , sources report that at this time , a dedicated rate component for socal to pay for power going forward is not included in the plan b that will be announced . the assembly is not certain whether this additional dedicated rate component will be needed . if the bond issuance is enough to cover the cost of power purchases , no dedicated rate component for forward purchases will be needed . by 2003 and 2004 , enough additional generation should be online that power prices should be low . therefore , the key question becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002 ? if the cost of power is high , rates may have to be increased at that time for socal to continue operating . ? the state would make a secured loan ( secured against the transmission assets ) to socal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect . this loan would be paid back by socal granting the government a lower rate of return on the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years . this provides an incentive for socal to sell its transmission system to the state , since it would not be making as much money from the system . were this to happen , the value would be credited toward the loan . ? in return , the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the filed rate doctrine case . also , socal would reduce the price of native power generation . finally , business customers ( including those that would have to pay the dedicated rate component ) would have the right to apply for direct access to power . if this plan is passed , ( better than 50/50 chance - as reported earlier ) the constitutional challenge from michael sturmwasser is still likely to go forward . this is because sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay socal s undercollect . sources believe it is likely that socal will eventually sell its transmission assets to the state if this plan is passed . therefore these assets would become municipal , making the reduction in the puc s authority constitutional . legislature leaves pg & e to throws of bankruptcytoday , there have been discussions concerning pg & e regarding "" plan b "" and the legislature . currently , the legislature is not considering offering keeley s "" plan b "" solution to pg & e. if the plan b mentioned above passes the senate , it is more likely that the state will purchase pg & e out of bankruptcy . both the assembly and the senate leadership are talking seriously about purchasing pg & e out of bankruptcy , though the republicans remain strongly opposed . the state then , would likely sell off pieces of pg & e ( except for the transmission assets , which it would retain ) ."

"" virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until the fourth quarter of this year , "" said ngpl president deborah mcdonald in an interview . "" basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the storage contracts are up for renewal every year . we ve been very successful in our efforts resigning our three major customers [ nigas , nipsco and peoples ] . "" despite increasing competitive pressure from northern border and alliance pipeline , the pipeline also has had surprising luck signing agreements with marketers and power generators . "" in contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the midcontinent and louisiana to chicago , we have been extending our horizons trying to find a new market in the marketers rather than the core ldcs . obviously the contract that we signed earlier thisyear with aquila energy for 500,000 mmbtu of transportation capacity has also really helped us be successful in our recontracting efforts , "" mcdonald said . "" we also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power generators . growth in ngpl will come from natural gas-fired generation . you probably saw our press release about the ameren contracts for [ construction of 1,700 mw of generation along thengpl system ] . in the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 3,000 mw of gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 mw next year as well [ which would represent up to 900 mmcf/d in gas transportation capacity ] . "" obviously another challenge is going to be [ the 1.325 bcf/d ] alliance pipeline coming into the market this fall . it s anyone s guess whether that will really fill up in a short period of time . i think a lot of that will be coming into chicago and moving back out on vector . but we re ready at hub america to kind of serve as a giant header system [ with texas eastern as an eastbound partner ] . "" mcdonald was not prepared , however , to announce the results of a recent open season for about 100 mmcf/d of capacity that will be available through a new interconnection between ngpl and tetco for eastbound transportation ."

"" within five years , the bandwidth market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets , "" he says . "" so for us , it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business . "" that s currently a $ 35 billion business . but critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas , especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications . and critics add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell capacity , they might prefer to do it through some channel that s independent of the control of a single market maker like enron . "" enron s argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator , and that it need not have deep telecom expertise , "" says lisa pierce , an analyst at giga information group in stamford , conn. "" but i m not convinced it s that simple . technology isn t a long-term competitive differentiator . "" houston-based enron broadband services inc. , formed last year , offers ip transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network . enron broadband services also trades - that is , makes a market by buying and selling - network capacity to and from other data carriers , conducting some of the transactions on enrononline . enron broadband services also offers content-oriented services , such as a video-on-demand service it will market with dallas-based blockbuster inc. to home viewers starting next month . "" when we started the gas business , they told us we were nuts , "" skilling says . "" they said , you re going to sell gas but not own production ? how does that work ? then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again , and even louder than before . they said this stuff moves at the speed of light ; you can never create a market . then in telecommunications , they said we were nuts again . "" despite its share of skeptics , some experts like enron s prospects in this space . "" i think aspects of this have the potential to be very big , "" says libby . "" the carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning . and i think it has a lot of potential [ for ] . . . selling it to businesses and giving them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need it . "" "" we aspire to that kind of model , "" says fred buehler , director of electronic business at eastman chemical co. in kingsport , tenn. "" in every sector , there will be one or two innovators who get out front and do things differently to create shareholder value , "" buehler says . "" we re trying to be one of them . "" market maker stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of enron s glistening 50-story headquarters , and the company s technological sophistication is immediately evident . traders like 26-year-old john arnold , who personally executes about $ 1 billion per day in trades , have real-time access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second buy-and-sell decisions . that information might be a meteorologist s prediction of a colder-than-normal winter across the plains states or a live news report of political instability in an oil-producing country in the middle east . behind the scenes , all of arnold s trades are instantly analyzed and processed by a sophisticated , proprietary risk-management system and then updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide . less than a year after launching the operation , 60 % of the world s gas is traded on enrononline . "" what we are doing , no one in the industry did 10 years ago . eighty percent of our income this year is from businesses that didn t exist 10 years ago , "" says skilling . for example , enrononline contributed heavily to its parent company s third-quarter earnings , which were up 31 % to $ 292 million , compared with the same period last year . "" the change is technology-driven , "" skilling adds . "" we couldn t do what we do without massive amounts of computing capability . "" in this regard , enron joins a short list of companies that includes wal-mart stores inc. , fedex corp. and american airlines inc. , which famously pioneered various mission-critical it techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of it-enabled industry leaders . among enron s boldest ideas is its use of a single , powerful software-based trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds of different markets . currently , enron trades more than 1,000 different commodities , such as gold , natural gas and metals , on enrononline . "" the core of our business is our business model , which is a centralized risk-management and market-making business model . it just so happens that the internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model , "" skilling says . but as a market maker , enrononline stands alone . for starters , unlike most other internet marketplaces , it s free . there are no transaction fees or catalog , inventory or subscription costs for users . "" enron has broken away from the pack in the last year , in terms of their capital growth , "" says ian wylie , vice president of e-business at bp amoco plc in london . "" and e-business is responsible for a lot of this change . "" even more unusual is enron s role as a principal in each transaction . that means enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it s involved , unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers and sellers . in fact , skilling , as well as mike mcconnell , who heads enrononline s global expansion efforts as president and ceo of enron global markets llc , dismisses much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan . "" [ many of the ] b2b guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board and people will start transacting , but it doesn t work that way , "" skilling says . "" you need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove . "" as either the seller or buyer in all of its trades , enron , an established brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets , guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on enrononline . "" we re creating markets that were highly illiquid , so someone has to put their reputation on the line to say , we ll deliver , "" skilling says . but guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants . guaranteed access also ensures marketplace liquidity . for enron , this is where the bricks and mortar come in . for example , to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market , enron paid $ 72 million in july for garden state paper co. , a recycled-newsprint mill in garfield , n. j. skilling s current market fancy is metals , and in may , enron bought mg plc , a london-based metals marketer . "" you have to break the liquidity logjam , and to do that , you have to take a risk position , "" skilling says . but once the logjam is cleared , enron is just as likely to sell off the brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new business . for example , to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation , enron is selling portland general electric co. , a portland , ore.-based power producer that it bought in 1997 , so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the online electricity market . eventually , enron may end up trading commodities that aren t even considered commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or empty railcar space . "" might we move into sauces or meats or grains ? potentially , "" says mcconnell , who was enron s de facto cio before moving into his current role . "" you have to be creative every day , "" mcconnell says . "" you have to be open-minded to trying new things . "" but what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is enron s core it-enabled business model , which is what puts it in a class of its own , analysts say . "" people have talked a lot about systems that they re about to roll out , but there is just not much out there for direct trading , "" says mike heim , an energy analyst at a. g. edwards & sons inc. in st. louis . "" enron rolled out its technology 10 months ago , and still there isn t much else out there . there hasn t been much competition [ because ] there isn t anybody in the same class . "" but just last month , houston-based dynegy inc. launched dynegydirect , an internet-based , commission-free trading site for energy and communications commodities . also last month , intercontinentalexchange in atlanta , whose partners include bp amoco and the hague-based royal dutch/shell group , added natural gas and power to its online trading system , which already included precious metals and crude oil . skilling doesn t get called "" nuts "" much anymore . in fact , he s a darling on wall street , where enron s stock has soared from around $ 40 per share last november to $ 81 as of this nov. 2 . as a result , enron - by all accounts , an old economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as a new economy pioneer . says skilling , "" we like to say we were b2b before there was b2b . "" thriving on the unconventional as head of two enron pipeline subsidiaries , mike mcconnell knew a lot more about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise call from enron president and chief operating officer jeff skilling . recalls mcconnell , "" jeff went into this whole thought process about how the internet is changing everything . he said , we need to make enron an e-business , and i need a guy that can run this as a business . we need to change the way we view technology . "" i thought he was a little crazy and i said , jeff , i m not a technology person at all , he said , no , seriously - this is going to be big . so i took over as ceo of enron global technology , "" and thus became the company s de facto cio , mcconnell explains . appointing a person with no technology background to the top it post is an unusual move . but enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a result . indeed , enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that s unusual in large , long-established companies , and in utilities firms in particular . mcconnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old louise kitchen , enron s head gas trader in europe , spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading system , recruiting it people from elsewhere in the company to do the development work . word of the web-based platform , enrononline , which is literally remaking the company , didn t reach top management until a few weeks before it went live . kitchen enlisted the support of enron s initially skeptical top traders , and she scoured the company for software developers and other experts . her small army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying on with their regular jobs . "" it s an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through all the bureaucracy , "" mcconnell says . "" no one went to the board and said , we want to change the way we trade . you just do it . "" glowing endorsement soon after mcconnell became the de facto cio of the $ 40 billion energy company , he joined eight of sun microsystems inc. s top houston customers at a breakfast hosted by sun ceo scott mcnealy . "" i was very nervous , "" recalls mcconnell , 40 . "" i mean , mcnealy is the guy , and here i know nothing about technology . i d been on the job maybe two weeks . "" mcnealy asked the attendees - all but mcconnell were middle-aged cios with many years of it experience - to introduce themselves in turn . "" when scott came to me , i said , i m the ceo of global technology , and we want to be the leader in b2b commerce in the world . he kind of sat back and said , how long have you been in the it business ? "" mcconnell explains . "" about nine days , i said , and we are going to take a little bit different approach to technology . scott chuckled and said , that sounds like enron ; it always looks at things differently . he then stated that my ceo title and enron s approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace soon , as this was the way of the future . "" mcconnell says mcnealy s endorsement had "" a huge impact "" on how he structured it at enron during the following year . "" i realized that we weren t too late to change our approach and take a commercial view of technology , "" he says - a view of it as an integral part of the business , not as something that supports business functions . "" none of the other companies were thinking our new way at all . "" taking a commercial view of it has led to a blurring of the line that traditionally separates it organizations from the business units they support . when mcconnell became ceo of global technology , enron had five cios who were predominantly operating independently inside the company s major lines of business . "" each cio had his own agenda , his own thought process , his own goals , and they did not communicate at all , "" he says . mcconnell established corporate standards for it , created a management team that included the five cios and put all it people under a new chief technology officer , philippe bibi . but it is far from centralized at enron . "" we wanted to make people think about technology not as it and support , but as an extension of your business , "" he explains . "" so we seeded people out into the business units . [ it ] directs the performance review process , but the business units have the greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated . "" firms like enron that merge it departments with the business units they serve will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses , says it organization expert robert zawacki , president of zawacki and associates in colorado springs and a professor emeritus at the university of colorado , also in colorado springs . "" we need more entrepreneurial leaders in it , and [ mcconnell ] is certainly one , "" he says . it makes it easier to be entrepreneurial , says mcconnell , who is now president and ceo of enron global markets . "" we really do like to try things and see what happens , and when you have an electronic platform like [ enrononline ] that we can model into different sectors , it s very inexpensive to try it . we are not afraid ; if it s not working , we ll just stop . "" - gary h. anthes and julia king"

"" with all due respect , i have 25 years of experience and knowledge -- and he has 25 days , "" freeman said . "" but he s the mayor , and he didn t like it that i didn t just say yes to everything he came up with . "" ????? to riordan , freeman s efforts to fight air pollution have given short shrift to the threat of skyrocketing power rates in los angeles . the mayor said freeman also failed to recognize potential conflicts of interest between his city and state roles in the power crisis . and he scoffed at freeman for saying he had lifted morale at dwp . ????? "" morale was terrible under him , "" riordan said . "" i mean , they are so relieved right now . "" ????? the backbiting has left associates suspecting the clash is really about egos . city councilwoman ruth galanter sees riordan and freeman as proud , successful men unable to say , "" i couldn t have done it without x , y and z. "" ????? "" each of them is used to being the boss and taking pleasure at being recognized as the boss , "" she said . ????? much of the conflict has taken place in private meetings . and the mayor , a republican multimillionaire , has taken pains to play down his dispute with freeman , a liberal democrat from tennessee who wears a cowboy hat and speaks with a southern drawl . ????? in an interview after his resignation , freeman laid out the conflict point by point , often in terms bluntly critical of the mayor . one of his concerns , freeman said , was that riordan in his final two months as mayor could reverse the agency s progress in protecting the environment . ????? freeman cited riordan s plans concerning coal-fired power plants in nevada and utah that are partly controlled by the dwp , the nation s largest municipal utility . the first is the mohave generating station in laughlin , nev. , a plant that has been blamed for spreading some of the haze that shrouds the grand canyon . the dwp had planned to sell its stake in the plant , but freeman said riordan ordered him to back out of the sale . ????? he described the mayor s move as a sign that riordan and his appointees on the board that oversees dwp were "" completely insensitive to the fact that that power plant is one of the most environmentally troubling plants in the west . "" ????? "" i ve worked real hard to try to build some environmental sensitivity into the dwp policy , "" freeman said . "" and i am concerned as to whether the current commissioners and the mayor have that sensitivity , and what they might do in the interim to basically overturn the progress we ve made . "" ????? the other plant is part of the intermountain power project in central utah . riordan has proposed building a new coal-fired generating unit there , but freeman said he objected because of the pollution it would cause . ????? in both cases , riordan said he was striking the appropriate balance between protecting the environment and meeting the energy needs of los angeles at an affordable cost . by keeping its share of the mohave plant and expanding the utah plant , los angeles can avert the astronomical price hikes of natural gas -- and the sharp rise in ratepayers bills that would follow , riordan said . ????? natural gas , which provides 26 % of the fuel for dwp plants , causes less air pollution than coal , which provides 51 % . the rest is mainly nuclear and hydroelectric . los angeles has averted rate hikes and blackouts in part because the dwp relies less on natural gas than most other california power providers . ????? "" i favor clean air and more natural gas , but not to the point where we re going to destroy the economy of los angeles , "" riordan said . ????? on the mohave plant , riordan questioned the benefit of selling the city s share to a buyer that would simply continue running it . ????? "" it s still going to be coal-driven , "" he said . "" how does selling it help the environment ? "" ????? the tension between the two has built steadily as the state power crisis has worsened . with the charismatic dwp chief drawing favorable news coverage in stories on how l. a. has dodged the crisis , riordan and the dwp commissioners began to view him as "" too big for my britches , "" freeman said . ????? the conflict reached its peak on april 17 , the day freeman resigned to become the governor s advisor . the dwp board president , kenneth t. lombard , said the mayor told commissioners that day that "" it made the most sense to release him immediately . "" ????? "" all we were doing , frankly , was release him from his responsibilities , and then whatever time he needed to clean out his office was fine with us , "" lombard said . ????? from riordan s standpoint , freeman needed to be stripped of his authority right away because of a potential conflict of interest : the city utility sells surplus power to the state , so freeman would be on both sides of the sales . ????? freeman , who had voluntarily bowed out of a dwp meeting on the state power crisis earlier that day , was outraged at his sudden release , in part because he was denied the chance to say goodbye to agency employees . in an interview , he called the conflict of interest assertion "" complete malarkey . "" ????? "" the insinuation that i have done anything less than protect the interests of the city of los angeles is bordering on slanderous , considering what i ve accomplished here , "" he said . ????? brian d arcy , who heads the union local that represents 6,000 dwp employees , agreed that riordan and his commissioners "" kind of ran him out of here . for david to be summarily jettisoned out of here without even a howdy-do is absolutely tacky , "" d arcy said . ????? riordan said freeman deserves "" an a-plus "" for his work at dwp . the mayor conceded that he knew of nothing that freeman had done "" to hurt los angeles . "" but , he added , "" when you have a conflict of interest , you have to act before anything happens . "" ????? freeman has long bridled at the oversight of dwp , not just by the mayor , but by the agency s board and the city council . in 1998 , he called for city charter amendments to consolidate authority in a more independent board of directors . the proposal went nowhere . ????? freeman s concerns were echoed in a report to be released monday . the rand enterprise analysis report was commissioned by the dwp . it calls for restructuring dwp management much the way freeman proposed . but riordan and galanter , who chairs the council s commerce , energy and natural resources committee , rejected the concept . copyright 2001 los angeles times"

yet it = 01 , s prett = yhard to pay your bills when a disproportionate plan forces your employer ou = tof business or out of california , = 018 said guardino . yesterday , the puc proposed raising rates for some employers by 50 to 75percent , which would be the second increase handed to the industrialbusiness community this year . for many employers , the recently proposedrate increases will equate to a 100 percent increase in electric bills inless than five months . = 01 & this is irresponsible behavior at a time when the state = 01 , s economy isalready reeling from an economic downturn that has hurt employers and lostjobs for working families , = 018 said guardino . = 01 & many companies , including roche pharmaceuticals , have had very aggressi = veenergy reduction programs in place for several years , which will continue . to further cut consumption - in order to pay for a non-proportional anddestructive rate increase -- for some employers , could mean cutting intotheir workforce , or leaving the area all together , = 018 said dr. james woody = , president of roche pharmaceuticals r & d in palo alto and chairman of theboard of the silicon valley manufacturing group . = 01 & we want to do our fai = rshare in paying for rate increases , but the disproportionate nature of thisproposal could be devastating to employers . we need a rate structure thatwill allow employers to thrive and help pull us out of this economicdownturn . = 018the silicon valley manufacturing group understands and acknowledges the nee = dto raise electric rates to help minimize blackouts , which will protect thepublic = 01 , s health and safety . however , to achieve desired conservation an = dfairness , it is essential that all californians share proportionally in rat = eadjustments . = 01 & proportional rate increases should be implemented with no rate shiftingbetween classes of energy users . member companies of svmg are committed tobeing part of the solution , as we work together to conserve power , retainour workforce and ensure a healthy economy , = 018 said guardino . = 01 & apparently , the puc is out of touch with working families , conservation = orjobs in california , = 018 said guardino . = 01 & it = 01 , s a naive proposal . it a = ssumes wecan put a firewall between working families and jobs their employersprovide ;

( ene ) each hold a 24.5 % stake and uog a 51 % stake in del . totalfinaelf is to operate the upstream phase of the project , which includes developing natural gas reserves in two blocks of qatar s giant offshore north field , in which the first wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 2005 . enron will focus on gas transportation , which requires building the 350-kilometer pipeline from a processing plant in ras laffan , qatar , to the al-taweelah terminal in abu dhabi and the jebel ali terminal in dubai . a further phase of the dolphin project will cover the delivery of an additional 1 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas , if it is deemed feasible . mees said the foreign partners have yet to agree on the precise details of their working relationship and on the price of the pipeline . totalfinaelf and del have said enron s estimated price for the pipeline is too high . sales and purchase agreements with u. a. e. customers are also not yet concluded . - by dyala sabbagh ; dow jones newswires ; 9714 3314260 ; dyala . sabbagh@dowjones . comcopyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . the ` dis-investment climatea v rajwade05/07/2001business standard10copyright ( c ) business standardin last week s article , i had expressed reservations about the 6/6 .5 per cent real gdp growth projected for the current fiscal year . recent events in the indian political economy do impinge on the credibility of governance , and may worsen the investment climate . a few years back , central ministers were talking of a $ 10 billion inflow of foreign direct investment by the turn of the century . the century has turned but the investment flow is stagnant at a quarter of that . consider some of the recent decisions , and their after-effects . the central government , having sold balco to sterlite , is unable to deliver . the strike continues and the poor chief minister of chhattisgarh , whose wife had to apply for a petrol pump licence to keep home fires burning , remains as partisanly recalcitrant as ever . surely future bidders for public sector assets , particularly in chhattisgarh , will remember balco . the very limited response to the privatisation of indian airlines , air india , mtnl , vsnl , and so on could well translate into low prices . nor would the recent controversy over will ( wireless in local loop ) be found reassuring by intending investors , whether foreign or domestic . the telecom sector has probably attracted more foreign investment than any other , one of the biggest investors being hutchison of hong kong . after the decision of the telecom regulatory authority of india on the issue , hutchison had announced that it will suspend further investment in the country . this seems unlikely to change after the more recent labours of the curiously acronymed got-it . mr paswan s argument that will is "" pro poor "" is difficult to swallow when the instrument reportedly costs more than a cell phone ! the cellullar phone operators are obviously unhappy and have gone in appeal and mr sivasankaran is offering to pay rs. 2,500 crore for a quarter of the will-space offered free to basic telephone operators . what a mess ! the hesitation of investors to come into the country would also get affected by the way the enron affair gets resolved ( more on this in a later article ) . incidentally , on the subject of the general direction of economic policy , unions sponsored by participants in the ruling alliance were themselves part of the previous week s strike . indeed , the bjp s own union boss has criticised the direction of government s policies , and so has the rss . mr gurumurthy of the swadeshi jagaran manch has termed the got-it deliberations on will a "" fraud on ( the ) people "" . if the leading party in the ruling coalition does not enjoy the confidence of its own followers/parents ( who seem closer to the congress or the left on issues like wto , privatisation or foreign investments ) , what credibility would it carry with investors , foreign or domestic ? nor does there seem to be any effort to explain the rationale underlying the policies to the people . apart from the general climate , some specific decisions in terms of foreign investment are equally puzzling . daewoo was denied permission to convert its dues from the indian company into equity . why ? would the government prefer the money to go out if and when daewoo india regains its health ? in another recent instance , four different applications of shell , the giant oil company , were rejected on one day . from what has appeared in the press , it is difficult to appreciate the rationale . one of the more curious reasons was that one shell application , if cleared , would have contravened a gujarat government law the interesting part is that the seller of the equity to shell , to buy which the investment application was made , is a gujarat government undertaking ! frankly , the ostensible reason for rejection seems less than convincing , more so when all such approvals are in any case subject to all applicable laws ! if there are question marks about the climate for direct investment , whether domestic or foreign , whether for greenfield projects or privatisation , one wonders whether the happenings in the equity market and the suddenly hyperactive securities and exchange board of india ( sebi ) would dampen portfolio investors enthusiasm as well . for a student of the financial markets , sebi s recent stance and summary punishments look to be in sharp contrast with its deafening silence when the index registered a very sharp rise up to 6,000 last year . or is it that only sharp falls , and not sharp rises , are prima facie pointers of malpractices ? all the affected parties have denied the charges and appealed to the courts . meanwhile , the fii inflows have held up well . but for how long particularly if the action against csfb is not backed by a transparent and convincing case ? ( to be sure , csfb hardly has a lily-white reputation in the last couple of years alone , it has faced the wrath of regulators in japan , uk , scotland , us and switzerland ) . and , with external debt flows likely to be negative in the current year , equity inflows are important to our balance of payments . not all signs are negative , particularly in the it sector . conseco , the big insurance company , has announced the takeover of a major call centre and is transferring a huge amount of back office work to india at a cost saving of $ 30 million . ( incidentally , if workers of the world were to unite as they have nothing to lose but their chains , our trade unions should be protesting against the conseco move in keeping with their anti-globalisation stance ) . major it companies like microsoft , sun , oracle , and others have announced that the recent slowdown in the us will not affect their plans in india . indeed , hewlett-packard and lucent are adding staff here . but , even in it , one would be foolish to ignore the potential competition from china . it is importing 20,000 english language teachers , which will negate our major competitive advantage . it is far ahead of us in hardware ( exports $ 20 billion in 2000 ) , telecommunication and other infrastructure , and catching up in software ( exports $ 3.6 bn last year ) . as it is , we are 41st in 49 countries analysed in the recent world competitiveness yearbook , down two notches from the last survey . if the general climate and credibility remain where they are , we can bid goodbye to even 6.5 per cent growth did the prime minister say 9 per cent?copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . may 7 , 2001houston chroniclemany find lanier still making sense by john williams it s a phrase much copied around houston , one that tells it like it is without telling it all -- "" that s my sense of it . "" when he was mayor , bob lanier repeated it so often that a passel of politicians and pundits , business leaders and bureaucrats began emulating it , at times mimicking lanier s whispery baritone . since then , "" that s my sense of it "" or "" my sense is "" have evolved into staples of houston political jargon . on the surface , the phrase appears blunt , that the teller is speaking exactitudes . when lanier used it to describe his observations , the message was straight to the point . but it s a good phrase , especially for a politician , because it provides a back door . the person using it is implicitly saying "" this is true based on current information . "" new information can catalyze a new sense of things . though lanier was term-limited from office in 1998 , his sense of things continues to be solicited by power brokers and wannabes . lanier is constantly on the horn , advising those tapping his sizable knowledge base . advice for bits of gossipin recent weeks , lanier has offered strategy to all three major mayoral candidates -- incumbent lee brown and city council members chris bell and orlando sanchez -- as well as to one who decided not to run , city controller sylvia garcia . he chats with people dallying with the 2003 mayoral race , with those watching water , transportation and downtown development issues . those who call lanier from time to time include former president clinton , gov. rick perry and enron chairman ken lay . sanchez calls lanier "" the oracle , "" after the greek deities who answered the questions of mortals . people call lanier offering observations and gossip in return for advice . ring-kissing by visiting devotees assuages his sizable ego . lanier s unique background -- he s been a sports reporter , lawyer , developer , banker , state highway commission chairman and mayor -- provides different vantage points for his observations . he can think through problems on different levels , decipher problems in politics , finance , development or public policy . if knowledge is power , lanier at times appears more the powerhouse than his successor . brown doesn t seem to enjoy the social and intellectual gamesmanship lanier relishes . lanier gabs with journalists , professors , lobbyists , pollsters and others who provide a sense of the city s intricate political balance of power . "" it s just not brown s shtick , "" said a lobbyist close to lanier and brown . "" part of being a good political player is the love of talking gossip . "" lanier s penthouse home atop the huntingdon in river oaks serves as a tibetan mountaintop for those seeking total political consciousness . lanier and wife elyse throw parties for political players of all ilk who allow him to remain a clearinghouse of information . keeping a hand in dealslanier continues to influence local decision-making . he pieced together a downtown convention hotel deal between the city and developer gerald hines . the downtown rail system is going down main and fannin largely because of lanier . afraid lanier would rise to swamp a broader rail plan for the entire region , metro officials pared down their vision to a level lanier would accept . metro chairman robert miller is a regular visitor at the laniers home . lanier was key in developing the greater houston partnership s recent comprehensive program for preserving mobility . lanier s current sense is that houston is healthy , striding to address transportation , water supply , air pollution and other problems . brown should win re-election , unless continued bumbling like a recent pothole scandal create a critical mass of negative publicity . either way , at age 76 , gimpy knees , problematic heart and all , lanier will be at the center of most civic discussion . in the end , lanier s lasting legacy may be the knowledge and wisdom he passes to the next generation of houstonians . at least , that s my sense of it . pay increases for state s top ceos05/06/2001associated press newswirescopyright 2001 . the associated press . all rights reserved . st. paul ( ap ) - paychecks for the highest-paid chief executives in minnesota are on the rise , but they still lag behind those of corporate leaders elsewhere , according to a published report . in a survey of the 100 largest publicly held corporations in minnesota , the saint paul pioneer press found the 10 highest-paid chief executives received a total of $ 230.1 million in 2000 , the newspaper reported sunday . that s up 71 percent from the $ 134.6 million the state s top 10 made two years earlier . the 1998 total was up 171 percent from 1993 . william mcguire of unitedhealth group was the highest-paid chief executive in minnesota , making $ 54.1 million in a package that included exercised stock options . the highest-paid chief executive in the country - citigroup s john reed - made $ 293 million in total pay in 2000 , according to a national survey in business week . the lowest-paid among the magazine s top 20 , enron s jeffrey skilling , pulled in $ 72.5 million - 29 percent above mcguire s compensation . the pioneer press survey also found that total cash compensation , which excludes gains from stock options and other long-term pay , rose 14 percent last year . that compared with an 18 percent gain for executives in the business week survey . "" the figures are troubling , "" says john stout , an attorney with the minneapolis law firm of fredrikson & byron . stout serves on the advisory board of the national association of corporate directors , and is a former president of the association s minnesota chapter . "" there is a general perception that boards of these big companies aren t doing their jobs when it comes to ceo compensation . "" stout stresses that his comments apply to the overall picture . looking at the pay alone at any single corporation is not enough , he says , noting that the performance of these companies is also a key consideration . the chief executive data breaks total pay into three categories : salary and bonus payments for 2000 , long-term compensation and stock options . the minnesota survey counts options as pay in the year that an executive exercises his or her right to buy the stock . other surveys count options in the year that they are granted , plugging in standard formulas to estimate their future value . long-term pay is mostly compensation in the form of "" restricted stock "" - outright grants of shares . typically , these grants carry a requirement that the executive must stay with the company to receive the shares . pay packages have rocketed in recent years , mostly because executives have won sizable stock options . as the stock market has soared , so has the value of their options . last year s pay packages in minnesota illustrate the importance of stock options . at unitedhealth group , salary and bonus payments accounted for only about a seventh of mcguire s overall package . the rest came from options exercised . options provided an even greater portion of overall pay for other top-paid chief executives in minnesota . the new pay survey for minnesota shows that 13 chief executives landed sizable gains , at least 25 percent , in cash compensation - salary and bonus - last year . meanwhile , the salary and bonus total fell significantly for just five chief executives . copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . india : why dabhol makes sense for reliance05/06/2001business line ( the hindu ) copyright ( c ) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd ( ksl ) ; source : world reporter ( tm ) - asia intelligence wire "" enron will always consider a legitimate proposal to sell an asset if it makes strategic sense but we are not currently pursuing the sale of our stake in dabhol power company .

mind "" - mr anil ambani to a question if reliance was interested in taking over the dabhol powerproject . to be sure , there is nothing to suggest that it could be happening yet . at least there is nothing in the public domain . but ever since word started going around that enron may sell its stake in dabhol power company ( dpc ) there has been intense speculation that reliance could be among the frontline contenders . the reliance industries managing director , mr anil ambani s statement is the only official comment on the subject to date . and it neither confirms nor denies the speculation in the market . it is indeed significant that mr anil ambani has not categorically ruled out reliance s interest in dpc . but why should the reliance group be interested in dpc ? how does dabhol fit into the group s plans ? in other words , how does it make sense for the oil-to-petrochemicals major to consider buying out enron from dpc if the opportunity arises ? acquiring dpc would make eminent strategic sense for the reliance group . the 2,184 mw power plant and the associated lng ( liquefied natural gas ) import and regasification facility fit in well with its growth plans in the power sector and in petrochemicals too . power is one of the focus areas in the reliance group s future expansion plans . but it has not been able to make serious progress in either the mega 3,960 mw project in hirma , orissa , or in the 447 mw patalganga project due to diverse reasons . while the hirma project is bogged down in sovereign guarantee issues , the patalganga project is held up with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) declining to provide escrow cover . in this backdrop , dpc s state-of-the-art , operational power plant presents a great opportunity for reliance power to make its mark . the project is at the right stage from an acquirer s viewpoint . one part of it is already operational while the other is set to go on-stream in a few months time . all the funds due from lenders , save a small part , have been disbursed and construction is almost completed . so no major project management problems here . the only sticky point is the dispute over the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) . but a new promoter can facilitate a review of the ppa and its controversial terms . besides , it may be easier for the government to take a fresh look at the project once enron is out of the picture and is replaced by an indian company . lng project , the clincher the dabhol project assumes added strategic importance due to the associated lng import terminal . reliance plans to set up lng import facilities on the gujarat coast . the lng business is a long-term proposition by its very nature . the key to its success lies in tying up the entire chain from the gas source and liquefaction facility to cryogenic transport , import terminals/regasification plant and , finally , finding assured buyers for the gas . the tricky part is identifying the gas supply source and a collaborator with the financial strength to set up the liquefaction and export terminals . the final challenge is to tie-up dedicated gas consumers in the vicinity of the import terminal . on all these counts the dabhol project is the best bet . it already has an assured gas supply source in west asia . the lng transporting vessel is almost ready in japan and will be delivered by november . the critical point here is that all the exploitable sources of natural gas in the west asia are tied up by one buyer or the other and any new lng importer on india s west coast may find it difficult to find fresh supply sources . the dabhol lng project assumes additional importance having tied up its supply source . besides , dpc has installed lng capacities much in excess of the needs of the power plant . it has close to 5 million cubic metres of capacity when all it would need is about 2.1 million cubic metres for power generation . this extra gas can be sold to industries in the gujarat/maharashtra belt which are hungry for energy . more important , from reliance s viewpoint is that this gas can be used to operate its patalganga plant where fuel cost is an issue . all it would need to do is lay pipelines from the import terminal to the hinterland . the natural gas can also be piped to its hazira petrochemical complex where it runs a mother cracker that can operate on naphtha or natural gas . it is presently operating on naphtha , which is notorious for its volatile price swings . one of the factors behind the fall in earnings growth of reliance industries in the last quarter of 2000-01 was the high naphtha cost . reliance can overcome such handicaps if it is able to shift to natural gas for the cracker . thus , whichever way one looks at it , the dabhol project appears an excellent strategic fit to reliance and its business plans . enron has denied any plans to exit from the project now but it has not ruled it out for all time . the multinational is turning its focus to energy trading and broadband businesses and its chief is on record saying that it should not be operating power plants in third world countries . given the troubles that it has encountered in the dabhol project , it would not be surprising if enron exits at some future date . but that is assuming that it gets a good price for all the assets created and the trouble endured . therein lies the rub in the entire deal . if reliance is able to offer that "" good price "" then it may land up with a strategically excellent acquisition . all these are possibilities . as of now , both enron and reliance would like to lie low and deny any interest in a courtship , at least in public . raghuvir srinivasancopyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . india :

darkness triumphs05/06/2001the times of indiacopyright ( c ) 2001 the times of india ; source : world reporter ( tm ) men & ideas / gurcharan dasthere is no use pretending that the departures of n. k. singh and montek singh are not going to hurt . they are . the two men are very different . montek is an elegant economist and nk is a natty networker who knows how to turn every screw in the government s machine . but both are reformers . n. k. singh has been transferred from the prime minister s office , where he coordinated the pm s economic agenda , to the planning commission . montek is leaving to head the independent evaluator s office for the international monetary fund . earlier , he was finance secretary , where he had spearheaded many an economic reform ever since the summer of 1991 . both men have fallen victim to the rss and the swadeshi lobby . although muralidhar rao and dattopant thengadi may have precipitated nk s recent departure , all anti-reformers are delighted . the communists , the leftists , the samatas and the mamatas , and the considerable forces of darkness in the congress would rather live with inefficient and corrupt public sector monopolies than have anything to do with competitive markets . montek s achievements are well-known , but nk too leaves a considerable record of reform , culminating in the recent path-breaking budget with dramatic reforms in labour , agriculture , and industrial policy . it contained both vajpayee s and sinha s reforms , and was a product of teamwork between north and south blocks . nk s networking skills with the ministries were crucial . he has left a mark on many vajpayee initiatives : the current momentum in building highways , the new "" open skies "" policy ( held hostage for so long by the civil aviation ministry ) , the decision to lease five major airports , the new energy behind ports privatisation , the resolution of the telecom tangle via an excellent telecom policy -- the ruckus over will notwithstanding , and the soon to be announced liberalisation of drugs price control . against these successes is failure in the power sector and the centre s inability to get the states to reform sebs . the lack of initiative on enron is also inexplicable . india can not afford to let enron blow up and destroy our credibility with the world . at one go we could lose our reputation for honouring contracts . remember , enron s board members , james baker and kenneth lay , are george w. bush s closest friends . reforms don t happen without reformers . even the most reform-minded minister needs a reforming officer to help build pro-reform coalitions in the bureaucracy , the party and in parliament . few realise a. n. varma s stellar role when he was prime minister narasimha rao s secretary . his legendary thursday meetings with economic secretaries became the crucial instrument for the blistering pace of reform between 1991 and 1993 . varma was a terror and ran his committee tightly . no one was allowed to travel on thursdays . the committee met for only two hours , when the reform in question was openly discussed . varma summarised and minuted the outcome and the reform proposal was taken to the cabinet for approval , and then on to parliament . many of us remember our excitement in those golden years as a new reform was announced every week . just as narasimha rao had varma , so manmohan singh had montek . chidambaram had jairam ramesh , and vajpayee had n. k. singh . these minister-officer partnerships have been crucial in making reforms happen . those who criticise the pmo for becoming too powerful forget that in our political model , ministries are independent and someone has to coordinate our chaotic government . it used to be the cabinet secretary , but when you want strategic management of change , then you require initiative and pro-activity . who knows , a powerful , hands-on secretary might have been able to prevent the fifth pay commission disaster -- the lowest point in our economic history of the 1990s . to our worthy anti-reformers , who are gloating over nk s and montek s exit , i ask : how can you oppose the work of reformers who are trying to , for example , reduce the theft of electricity by employees of the state electricity boards ? if this theft is reduced from 30 per cent today to only 18 per cent , there will be enough capital to build sufficient new power capacity . but the only way to stop thievery is by privatising distribution , for no private distributor will allow his power to be stolen . thieves don t steal power in mumbai and calcutta because distribution is private . our anti-reformers retort , "" don t privatise power , just catch the thieves ! "" well , for fifty years we have not been able to catch them . should we wait another fifty ? think about this : the next time you oppose reforms and reformers you vote for public sector thieves rather than competitive markets . liberalisation is not a matter of ideology . it is common sense to want clean , uncorrupt services . the only losers in privatisation will be thieves and lazy workers . the winners will be the indian people . comment : gurcharandas@vsnl . com or post box 3046 , new delhi 110003copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . should we persuade enron to stay on ? 05/06/2001the times of indiacopyright ( c ) 2001 the times of india ; source : world reporter ( tm ) in black & white / harry dhaulyes . renegotiate by all means , but honour the deal if enron is the sole evil in the power sector , i would say remove it from india . if that solves the myriad problems of our industry , farmers and consumers , go ahead and ask enron to leave . but it won t solve the underlying problems , will it?i am not holding a brief for enron , but suppose you ask the company to leave . what next ? it is only another way of postponing decisions which electricity boards have to take anyway . though facts and figures have been thrown around about how much india would gain if enron were to leave , i assure you our liabilities would be much more . there would be penalties to pay for various contractual obligations . in all this talk , most people forget one thing -- the sanctity of a contract . is there a rule of law in this land ? this kind of commercial deal is done the world over . if a government can t honour a contract and that too the biggest india has got , how can you expect anybody else to do so ? okay , if the forces operating in the market have changed and the contract needs to be renegotiated , do so . but is it fair to tell a company after a few years : sorry , please pack up and leave ? especially a company which has stuck to all the conditions of the contract . and imagine what this will do to foreign direct investment in our country . is this the climate which foreign companies would want to be thrown into ? i don t think so . having said this , there is still ample scope for renegotiation on the commercial terms . the tariffs can be brought within reasonable limits and there are reasons for this . firstly , gas prices are going down , so we can get a good deal out of this project . secondly , the prices of gas turbines have also gone down and we should be able to benefit from it . thirdly , the efficiency of gas turbines has gone up by nine per cent . this will bring down the cost of electricity . of course , critics of enron will say the power generated is costlier than that generated within the country . but that s natural considering the amount of power bought is less than optimal . once this quantity goes up , the rates will come down and be on a par with government power projects based on liquid fuels like the national thermal power corporation in kerala . the tariffs , contrary to popular notion , of both are in a similar range -- rs 4-5 per kilowatt hour . but is ntpc being paid for the power it generates ? no . the basic mistake lies with our policy-makers who allowed such power projects based on liquid fuels . even thermal power , generated by ntpc , costs rs 1-1.50 . but this is not being paid for by state governments . what s the justification for that ? state electricity boards have to pay close to rs 26,000 crore to central power-generating units -- rs 17,000 crore has to be paid to ntpc . so how will the scrapping of the enron project help ? despite all this , there is severe power shortage . renegotiation would help restore some of the lost confidence among foreign investors . the deal can and should be improved in national interest . and more importantly , the government should honour it . how can you penalise a company which has brought the largest investment into the country ? also , if enron leaves , what about its assets here ? of course , somebody could buy it but again the question arises : will they be paid ? will asking enron to leave help our electricity sector ? this kind of mob mentality that targets enron won t help matters . our power utilities should be improved first .

"" if pacificorp is required to meet the terms the cooperative arranged with enron , the cooperative initially would be able to buy electricity at $ 18.75 per megawatt hour . the rate would rise to $ 25.13 per megawatt hour by the end of the five-year agreement - still about one-tenth the current wholesale market price . "" as soon as the lawsuit is settled , they re bound to sell us this power , "" palmer said . pacificorp spokesman dave eskelsen said the company s position is that it is not obligated to let the association use its lines , and that the company is not violating antitrust law with its refusal . the utility has filed a petition with the idaho public utilities commission , seeking support for its stance . copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . money reportprofessionals safer picks paid off last quarteranne bagameryinternational herald tribune05/05/2001international herald tribune15 ( copyright 2001 ) eat well or sleep well . the process of buying stocks requires an investor to make many choices along the way , but they all boil down to that one : whether to buy shares in companies that may bring huge rewards , but at a certain risk , or to make safe , steady bets that would not keep anyone awake at night . professional investors , however , try to have it all : they want to recommend stocks that will pay off handsomely for themselves and their clients , but they also want to narrow the odds . that is why analysts and money managers spend their days ( and sometimes nights ) researching the fundamentals of an industry sector , or poring over technical charts , or listening to alan greenspan to try to divine the next macroeconomic trend . sometimes the market throws a curve , and all that hard work goes for naught . but sometimes it pays off . the first quarter of 2001 was one of those times . of the 92 stocks recommended by professionals in the money report in the first three months of the year , 52 rose in price by the cut-off date of april 27 an astounding record , considering the carnage in world stock markets during january , february and march . otherwise , 38 stocks fell , most of them at the high end of the technology spectrum . among the notables , xtl biopharmaceuticals plc , the biggest decliner in the period , fell more than 51 percent , and cisco systems inc. , a bellwether for the internet economy , tumbled 24 percent . rounding out the picture , of the remaining two equities , boeing co. was unchanged from the price at which it was recommended , and enron corp. was mixed : investors who bought shares in the huge engineering company on feb. 10 , when they were recommended at $ 80.20 , would have booked a 21 percent loss by the end of april , while those who waited until march 31 to jump in at $ 58.10 a share would have made 9 percent . it would be tempting to conclude that the overall record shows the wisdom of choosing staid , boring old economy stocks over flighty , unprofitable new economy parvenus . it is true that in the first quarter , the safe bets usually paid off . unilever nv , the british-dutch consumer products giant , and wal - mart stores inc. , the world s biggest retailer , rose 5 percent and 4 percent , respectively , in a quarter when neither did much of anything except take care of business . rakuten inc. , a japanese internet retailer that was the darling of the market last april , had come to earth by this year : its shares , recommended as a turnaround play in february , fell 25 percent . - nowhere was the contrast between bricks and clicks more pronounced than in the lehman brothers inc. list of "" 10 uncommon euro values , "" featured in the feb. 24 issue . of the 10 stocks recommended , six tumbled , including such technology brand names as alcatel sa ( down 19.7 percent ) and siemens ag ( down 1.5 percent ) . logica plc , a british technology-consulting concern , was the biggest loser , falling 31 percent . the four that rose are in plain-vanilla businesses such as supermarkets ( ahold nv ) , electricity ( eni spa ) , cars ( psa peugeot citroen sa ) and lemsip ( reckitt benckiser ) . the folks at lehman did set a good example for individual investors by diversifying , picking stocks in a variety of sectors from six countries , and emphasizing that these were stocks to buy and hold for the year , not flashes in the pan . speaking of good examples , special mention should go to three analysts whose astute stock-picking stood out in the first quarter : howard ward of gabelli growth fund . with mergers and layoffs and chaos swirling all around media stocks , it takes a courageous person to recommend aol time warner inc. and viacom inc. but mr. ward , who participated in the previous quarter s investment roundtable , sifted through the industry wreckage and noted that while the stocks of aol and viacom had been battered , the companies business models remained intact meaning that , fundamentally , they were still doing something right . aol shares rose 16.6 percent ; viacom s , 4 percent . bill greiner of umb financial corp. s umb bank . energy stocks , as a group , were some of the best performers , helped along by a rise in oil prices and the salutary effects of a wave of mergers two years ago . mr. greiner identified winners in a range of industry subsectors , including integrated oil ( bp amoco plc , which rose 12 percent in the period ) , gas ( apache corp. , up 9 percent ) and oilfield services ( halliburton co. , up 6.5 percent , and schlumberger ltd. , up 10 percent ) . richard davidson of morgan stanley dean witter & co. asked to identify european stocks resistant to a slowdown , in the feb. 17 issue he named some solid winners and refreshing logic . he recommended two cable-television companies , sogecable sa of spain and telewest plc of britain , reasoning that people without the money to go out could always stay home ; sogecable rose 18 percent , while telewest slipped 1.7 percent . he also suggested two tobacco stocks , altadis sa of spain and swedish match ab , reasoning that the last thing a financially struggling smoker would give up was the habit . swedish match rose 19 percent , while altadis fell 8 percent . finally , mr. davidson recommended a pair of security-services companies securicor plc of britain and securitas ab of sweden because he reckoned that in tough times , people might have less wealth than before , but they would want to hang on to whatever they had . securitas rose 4 percent , while securicor slipped 3.6 percent . - one group of prognosticators that did not find fortune in the first quarter were the shorts , analysts who recommended stocks to sell or avoid . this is a high-risk game in the best of times a wrong bet can have theoretically unlimited losses but it is particularly nerve-wracking in a reluctant bear market such as the current one , when pockets of optimism keep peeking through the gloom . of the six companies mentioned as fundamentally lacking in value or prospects , four rose : banca di roma spa , body shop international plc , general electric co. and national express plc. the other two , natexis banques populaires and pepsi bottling group inc. , had mild losses . copyright , 2000 dow jones & company , inc. all rights reserved . godbole committee meets sans dpc representation05/05/2001press trust of india limited ( c ) 2001 pti ltd. mumbai , may 5 ( pti ) the godbole committee , set up for renegotiating the estranged power purchase agreement ( ppa ) between us energy major enron-promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) and the state electricity board ( mseb ) , saturday held its first internal meeting sans representatives of the multinational .

"" if you could spray dye on dollars and trace them through , you would see pipelines out of houston carrying energy and pipelines coming back carrying dollars , "" said graef crystal , a former executive pay consultant to fortune 500 companies who now writes and lectures on executive compensation . "" it s an involuntary transfer of wealth from the california consumers to ken lay and his cohorts . there s nothing illegal about it . but it doesn t make the people of california feel very good .

"" to be honest i don t know what the point is in looking at power executives compensation , "" denne said . "" companies like enron have been working to put solutions on the table , to help california with its energy problems . "" free-market advocates defend the energy salaries .

"" these guys are plain , unadulterated , greedy jerks , "" dodson said . regulators too have raised questions about the energy company profits . a california independent system operator study said "" market power "" exercised by enron and other suppliers resulted in unfair profits that contributed $ 6.87 billion to the cost of wholesale power last year . the federal energy regulatory commission has ordered enron , williams and other top suppliers to prove their prices were "" just and reasonable "" or refund more than $ 100 million . market power is seen when firms that control a substantial supply of a commodity withhold it or use other tactics to drive up the price . enron and the other companies named in the study have denied such tactics . but williams cos. agreed tuesday to repay $ 8 million to settle federal charges that it shut down two generating units so it could charge higher market prices at other power plants . williams denies any wrongdoing . in total , california paid $ 28 billion for electricity last year , four times the 1999 costs . earnings statements show profits at many energy wholesalers tripled in 2000 . experts say the pay handed to these energy executives last year is higher than most other major corporations are paying . but most other corporations didn t see profits triple last year . for instance , ford ceo jac nasser , whose company owns the irvine-based lincoln and jaguar brands , collected $ 12.4 million last year , up 13 percent . but ford s 2000 earnings declined by half in 2000 . boeing ceo phil condit , whose space division is headquartered in seal beach , collected $ 20 million , up 342 percent . boeing s 2000 earnings were down 8.5 percent . "" from what i can see they are paying themselves very well , although i wouldn t say it s excessive , "" crystal said of the energy companies . but crystal made an exception for lay , whom he classed with a group of executives , including disney s michael eisner and citigroup s sanford weill , who have earned $ 100 million a year , even if their companies have performed poorly . last year eisner was paid $ 73 million by disney , up 44 percent , although earnings fell 30 percent . citigroup , the new york financial conglomerate , paid weill $ 223 million , up 142 percent . the company s earnings rose 20 percent . enron s earnings were not particularly strong last year . profits were up only 10 percent . the company attributed that to a series of write-offs , including a $ 300 million loss at an argentine water company . excluding those one-time charges , profits were up 32 percent , enron said , and its stock nearly doubled in value . most of the energy companies examined by the register did better , reporting profits , on average , up 187 percent . now look at the numbers reported by california s two largest utilities , who are trapped between the high costs of wholesale energy and a public utilities commission cap on charges to ratepayers : edison international , parent of southern california edison , reported a loss of $ 1.9 billion . edison cut pay for ceo john bryson nearly 50 percent , to $ 1.62 million . pg & e , the northern california utility , reported a loss of $ 3.4 billion last year and more than halved the pay of ceo robert d. glynn jr. , to $ 944,000 . "" a lot of money s been made by these ( energy traders ) , but i wouldn t want to suggest that there is something inherently bad about doing that , "" said ted craver , edison s chief financial officer . "" they have a role to play . if the companies do well , and their executive compensation is based on stock options , it stands to reason the executives will do well . "" the federal energy regulatory commission is investigating allegations of overcharging , and last week put price caps in place for california power generators . but experts say that will have little effect on the profits of firms like williams and enron , whose primary role is as traders . "" i think profits will continue to grow for the next year or two , as long as markets are volatile . that s when traders do well , "" said brian youngberg , a senior utility analyst for edward jones . "" it certainly looks like 2001 will be another record year for energy company prices , "" agreed paul fremont , who follows energy stocks for jeffries & company . free market supporters like ucla s cockrum and enron s lay say it would be wrong to blame either energy companies or deregulation for california s high energy prices . "" what has happened in california over the past four years is not deregulation . it is misguided regulation , "" lay wrote in an opinion piece in the san francisco chronicle in march . "" if done right , deregulation means choice and competition . deregulation means lower prices . deregulation means innovation . california has the opportunity now to get it right .

this could be a can of worms . colleen , what is the contract interruption ? does the citygate production deals stay with enron ? if they stay with enron , then does ces realize this ? are the producers receiving two payments , one from enron and one from ces . maybe this has already be discussed and decided , but i haven t heard the official word . currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that ces needs . the numbers that herndon ldc schedulers provide to enron are reduced by the production . i think chris put these buy/sells in the system to appease john and keep the enron accounting system whole . currently the market demand tickets in sitara are reduced by the citygate supply . the pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets , but the market demand numbers need to be increased . then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that chris germany has been creating . however if this production gas is not enron s , then enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments . from : katherine l kelly @ ect 03/13/2000 10:34 am to : joan veselack/corp/enron @enron , robert allwein/hou/ect @ectcc : wade r price/hou/ect @ect subject : re : ces pool gashey guys , i wanted ya ll to see the below messages as well since these are tco deals . i m little confused now , because wade had informed me that these were all deals behind the citygate that john singer had been doing and that ces retail was pulling gas directly from these points . we found a few like this on cng last week . the way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with ces retail . chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to ces retail , but right now he s priorities are just a bit different . i guess why i m a little confused on these is that when i pulled up the phoenix dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the cpa s. wade - do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal ?

"" i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . "" she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . "" i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge-building with state commissions . "" wood said he understood "" the political issue here with respect to federal-state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . "" staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . "" if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , "" one staffer responded . wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost/benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , "" but make it clear that if we don t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain t going to do it .

( yes - apologies if there is confusion ) with regard to a global message , i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature , applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities . with these operating standards implemented worldwide , we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide . these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly , with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations . i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across . agreed - but the note was targeted at europe - would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and shona ) finally , a question regarding timing . the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated ( shona took this to do after brent s return to houston ) for comments to all business controllers . i don t believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed , understand and have implemented these standards . and not to belittle the process of creating the standards , the tough part ( and the real meat behind this ) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards . my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year . there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report . shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this , and i believe that mike has already been working with james new . so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against . would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and ( hopefully ) our first draft of a meaningful exception report ? can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to shonasorry that this response looks so long . i have been interrupted 20 times while responding , so i hope that it makes sense . thanks for sharing this with me . since you asked for input , i hope that you don t mind that i gave you some . -- sally - certainly not - and thanksmike jordan09/26/2000 08:14 amto : fernley dyson/lon/ect @ect , sally beck/hou/ect @ectcc : subject : a note being sent out under john sherriff s name - your thoughts on the cover note ? fernley / sallyoff and on ( with jackie gentle s help ) i have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page summary ) . we are in the final stages of this process - where we draft a cover letter for john which will introduce this for inclusion within globalflash ( the enron europe newsletter ) have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ? mike"
