chairman.enron@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide2@enron.com,Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron s common stock  which means that Enron s common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE s decision.The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks  which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron s stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau  LLC "Pink Sheets."

To the extent (and onlyto the extent) that a purchase is not otherwise paid by any party or payableby another party meeting the credit standards set forth in the ISO Tariff(another "Qualified Party")  DWR will assume financial responsibility forall purchases by the ISO in its ancillary services and imbalance energymarkets based on bids or other offers determined to be reasonable. Suchdetermination of reasonableness will be made by DWR on a case by case basisand communicated to the ISO.  All bids into the ancillary services andimbalance energy markets will be deemed to be contingent on the acceptanceof financial responsibility by DWR  to the extent not paid or payable byanother Qualified Party.  Unless a supplier is otherwise notified  any bidaccepted by the ISO will be deemed to have the financial support of anotherQualified Party or DWR as specified in this notice.  In addition to theforegoing  DWR will assume financial responsibility for all purchasesresulting from the issuance by the ISO of emergency dispatch instructions to the extent not paid or payable by another Qualified Party.  Payment forsuch purchases shall be made according to the rate specified in the ISOTariff for emergency dispatch instructions.  The ISO and/or DWR reserve theright to rescind or modify the foregoing arrangements at any time and forany reason  including a successful rehearing or appeal from the April 6order.As the FERC determined in its February 14 order that DWR is a creditworthycounterparty  the ISO believes that the foregoing arrangements meet therequirements of FERC s April 6 Order. Accordingly  the ISO expects thatsuppliers will honor their obligations under the ISO Tariff and relatedagreements to respond to ISO dispatch instructions.Don FullerDirector  Client RelationsCalifornia ISOPhone: 916-608-7055E-Mail: dfuller@caiso.com

enron.announcements@enron.com,all.worldwide@enron.com,In an effort to protect Enron s e-mail system from harmful viruses  the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you  the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses  malicious code  business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs  *.exe  *.com  *.bat  *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails  you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail  in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

However  commodity may be a different story.  Steve  can you verify if you want the data center as part of the commodity deal  and the usage?  I would assume that you want to include the data center on the commodity deal.  As far as EB 1 and 2  that s the rough approximation I had.  Steve probably has more exact usage if needed. -----Original Message-----From:  Hansen  Bob  Sent: Monday  July 30  2001 1:19 PMTo: Bolton  Stacey; Ring  RichardSubject: Re: Follow up on Greening the bldgStacy/Richard Is the data center (7210 Ardmore St.) going under the same deal?  It hasn t been part of the discussion so I ll assume no until I hear back.Based on our last meeting I think it was estimated that EB 1 will use 28 million kWh/year  and when EB 2 will use 42.5 million kWh/year.  So a total of 70.5 million kWh/year.  Is this your understanding too?

mark.e.taylor@enron.com,marcus.polach@enron.com|paul.simons@enron.com|paul.simons@enron.com,Marcus:I tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone - the number I was give for you appears to be at some other company entirely.  Please feel free to call me once you get this note to discuss further.The OMLX issue related to having the terminal of a non-US futures exchange in the US.  There is a related but different issue you can discuss with Paul Simons that came up in connection with the ZUMA 2000 trading system in London.  On that system  we would have been able to trade financial contracts electronically.  The problem was that our counterparties were also US entities and  in some instances  trading from the US.  I believe that the advice we received from Cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all outside the US we would have been able to trade on ZUMA 2000.   Of course  all of this relates to derivatives trading.  If the system you have in mind will be for the physical commodities  we should include Jeff Hodge in the discussion.I have no objection to you contacting David Mitchell directly.  I am copying Paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has already dealt with similar issues.Marcus Von Bock Und Polach03/30/99 10:18 AMTo: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Mark  in the course of our effort to establish internet-based click-and trade business for a number of commodities (mainly gas  power) in the main markets of Europe (and with respect to pulp&paper also possibly the US)  I think  it is necessary to evaluate the CFTC issues. I understand that Cadwalader has given some advice earlier this year re. OMLX and think it may be best to contact them. Who do you think  I should contact (I understand  the person we earlier dealt with was a David Mitchell) and how do you want to play this contact. Greetings  Marcus.

I have turned a $20 000 investmentaccount into a $30 000 investment account with 20 days!  Allbecause of the Option Investor Newsletter!  Keep it up!!!Thanks! Doug*****I have traded about 20 calls  and YTD annual ROI about5000 %  pretty fair return if I can keep it up a year  Thanks Don*****Once again  I just want to say how much I enjoy the newsletter.You and your team do an outstanding job. I also subscribe toother newsletters such as McMillan s "Option Strategist"  so Iappreciate quality when I see it. Your newsletter is first rate!Thanks  David*****Your newsletter is the best I have ever received.  Over thepast two years I have spent hundreds of dollars on newsletters.This is by far the best and the only one I have made money from.I am so excited about your newsletter that I am telling lots offriends.  I also think you give conservative advise that Iappreciate.  I am very conservative and it has taken me twoyears to realize that I could do options.  With your help I havealready been successful in one week!  We own lots of Dell stockbut the options are even more fun to watch go up.  I also followWLA  GPS  and CSCO very closely.  We also own those stocks.Options make a lot of sense to me when I m familiar with thestocks and know how they act.  I guess earnings season is alsoa very good time to own options.  I am nervous about doingoptions after the earnings season.   Claudia*****The Option Investor has been an enormous help in my buddingtrading career.  In fact  it is the first source of informationI ve bought (and I ve spent thousands on books  workshops  andother website subscriptions)where I can demonstrate a directand nearly immediate link between the information and actualfinancial success in trading.More importantly than this perhaps is your forthright statementabout the importance of what I would call maintaining theintegrity of the relationship between you and your customers.You are clearly a "straight shooter"  and this is as apparentin the no nonsense approach you are taking to the websitecheating problem as it is in the advice you provide in thenewsletter. Bruce*****I cannot tell you how much I support you in your actions.The people who abuse the system are not only taking advantageof you  but of all of us who are willing to pay the VERYreasonable amount for what we get.  The return on my investmenthas been several hundred times over the amount I give youand personally I thank you for taking these steps.Thank you  Lloyd*****Dear Jim: I just wanted to let you know you have done a greatjob for me.  I have made $10 000 profit in just one week!!  AOL YHOO  and CSCO have all been good picks.  I am signing upfor your yearly subscription.

Feel free to use this if you like. Thanks  NODOZ*****Jim: I want to thank you and compliment your service.  Pleasefeel free to post my unsolicited remarks below as a referenceto your Newsletter Service.     Thanks for the followup on the Japan market sentiment.It s great to know that when there is a big market event youare on top of things for us.  I subscribed a few weeks ago andwant to say that I am most satisfied with the newsletter.     I was experienced with stocks and options before I subscribed but I was kind of "trading in the dark " with a lack of self-confidence in my strategies.  Now with the newsletter  I foundthat I was pursuing the right strategies but didn t have theconfidence and trading skills to perform good executions.  Theconfidence gained through the Option Investor Newsletter and thetime saved in searching for opportunities (great opportunity playsalready summarized by the newsletter) has helped me focus on "betterexecution."  My results have improved dramatically.  Since earlyJune when I started the two-week-trial  my option brokerage accountnet worth has increase from $20 000 to $70 000 today.  I alsobelieve that I am trading a lot smarter  actually incurring muchless risk than before.Thanks  Tony*****Dear James: I would like to take a moment to thank you for thejob that you and the Option Investor staff do.  I am sure we(subscribers) don t know half of what you guys must contendwith day in and day out to get the newletter to us.  However do know that you are appreciated.    I must readily admit that I am totally addicted.  I lookforward to Sunday  Tuesday and Thursday nights.  I am like achild at Christmas time.  When I first subscribed to yournewsletter I was somewhat unfamiliar with your format andrecommendations.   I would pick half hazardly and not plan myexecution strategy.  However  as I sat back and analyzed yourpicks  paper traded for sometime  I then started actual trading.I went from a negative portfolio to a positive within 3 weeks all the credit going to you guys!  I am still attempting toconcur the art of letting the profits run (I still tend to getout a little too quick)  but I am better at stopping out whenthe trade hasn t gone as expected.    Keep up the good work and I look forward to a long lastingrelationship.Thank you  Darrel*****Jim:    I just had to write you to tell you that during my firsttwo week free trial  your information made me $2 000 from a$2 000 investment! Needless to say  I subscribed and since thenthe website has made me an additional $2 500. All of this in lessthan 30 days! I have been to Wade s WIN site free for a weekand your information is much easier to understand and use. Ihaven t been this excited in years! Your site has literallychanged my life!Steve*****I am just a lame rookie with options  but I profited nicely($15K) in one week with one trade per your news letter  and itwas not from an Internet stock! I would have profited greaterfrom another transaction if I would have heeded "pigs get fat  hogs get slaughtered".

exchangeinfo@nymex.com,mark.e.taylor@enron.com,Notice No. 00-421December 12  2000MEMORANDUMTO:  ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERSFROM:  Neal L. Wolkoff  Executive Vice PresidentDATE:  December 12  2000RE:  Reminder of Price Fluctuation Limits Applicable to Trading on NYMEX=20ACCESS&#61495;The purpose of this Notice is to remind Members and Member Firms that an=20Executive Committee Resolution that was ratified by the Board of Directors==20and that concerns Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules app=ly=20to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; (Resolution)  remains in effect and will==20continue until February 1  2001  unless Members are notified otherwise by t=he=20Exchange.As background  on October 6  2000  the Exchange issued a Notice to Members==20(#347)  advising Members and Member Firms that the CFTC had approved this==20Resolution.  The Resolution  which became effective with the commencement o=f=20the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session on Sunday  October 8  2000  has amended on= a=20temporary basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those==20rules apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;. The Resolution is included==20below.The Resolution was issued so as to ensure the successful reimplementation o=f=20the new implied order functionality on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.  By=20significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to trading==20activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;  the Resolution reduces the=20possibility that a price limit would be triggered by the implied=20functionality.The Resolution amends  on a temporary basis  Exchange price fluctuation lim=it=20rules - but only with respect to market activity occurring on NYMEX=20ACCESS&#61495;.Thus  the new price limits that went into effect last week for Natural Gas==20are further expanded as provided by the terms of the Resolution.The Resolution amends the Exchange=01 s price fluctuation limit rules with==20regard to trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; in four ways:(1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange==20futures contract that has such limits) are expanded to 200% of the initial==20and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two contrac=t=20months for energy contracts  or to the first contract month with limits in==20effect for metals contracts  of that futures contract under the applicable==20rule.(2) This expanded limit (e.g.  200% of the limits for the front two months==20for energy contracts) is applicable to all contract months for that futures==20contract.(3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer= =20trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; generally would be halted immediately  rath=er=20than requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During t=he=20last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session  the market would be halt=ed=20only far as long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price==20limits.(4) As a clarification  the Resolution suspends use of certain =01&haircuts==018=20narrowing price limits based on notional settlement prices.  Specifically ==20NYMEX Rule 6.56 (Settlement Prices and Price Fluctuation Limits for NYMEX==20ACCESS&#61495;) establishes the use of notional settlement prices as the ba=se=20point for price limits (until the actual settlement prices from the RTH=20session can be input into the system.)  NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; will continue =to=20use such notional settlement prices under the Resolution.  However  Rule 6.=56=20reduces applicable price limits by certain specified percentages during the==20period when notional settlement prices are used as the base point for=20establishing limits. Such =01&haircuts=018 are not being used under the Res=olution;=20the Exchange will resume use of such haircuts following the expiration of t=he=20Resolution.Finally  the Resolution also clarifies one aspect of existing Exchange=20practice.  In the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;=20traded for five minutes at a price fluctuation limit applicable to Regular==20Trading Hours (RTH) trading  then the RTH session would open with expanded==20price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rule.  This=20practice will continue to be followed during the period when the Resolution==20is in effect  even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading==20during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; trading session because the market had not==20hit the expanded limits applicable only to NYMEX ACCESS&#61495;.*  * * *As noted  these temporary amendments to the Exchange=01 s price limits shal=l=20expire on February 1  2001  unless Members are notified otherwise by the=20Exchange.*  * * *If you have any questions  please contact Stu Homler  Director  NYMEX=20ACCESS&#61495; Operations  NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department  at (212)=20299-2754  Matt Morano  NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; Department  at (212) 299-2679  =or=20Brian Regan  Senior Associate General Counsel  at (212) 299-2207.APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEEOF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICEFLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTSThe Executive Committee of the Board of Directors herebyResolves that  until further notice  the price fluctuation limit rules for==20each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that==20has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below==20with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc:The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two==20contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the==20applicable rule.This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit=s)=20shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide==20bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri=ce=20fluctuation limit  trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01 s designe=e. =20Following resumption of trading  the price limits in effect shall be 200% o=f=20the limits applicable to RTH trading.

As currently structured this would mean that any EOL user  including ENA  would be able to run a report to see detail behind bids on pipeline capacity.  Obviously this would be a problem under the marketing affiliate rules.  At their last meeting Dale and Shelley outlined three possible ways to address this:Add security such that ENA/EES users cannot run reports on pipeline bid data.  I understood leaving the meeting that this might be technically difficult or expensive.Exclude pipeline data from the reporting feature altogether.  Here the story was that while this was not necessarily difficult  EOL could not make any changes before version 2 was ready.  The impression was that this would be possible after version 2.Erect procedural firewalls.  Mark Taylor suggested that perhaps we could inform all ENA and EES personnel that the company has a policy that prevents them from running reports on GPG data.  This probably isn t a good long-run solution  but we all agreed that it might serve as a bridge measure.  This approach is supported by the fact that Enron Networks has already entered into a confidentiality agreement with GPG.Solutions 1 and 2 require extensive technical work and unfortunately we cannot currently spare the technical resources required for it. We can go with solution 3 at present with the understanding that in the absence of a large volume of trades it might be the permanent solution. This is something that legal on both sides would have to agree to. Steve will check with their legal department to see if this is acceptable. Dale can you please check with Mark Taylor.Further the credit departments on both sides should meet and iron out the credit issues. Steve is going to make sure the two credit departments talk to each other.Thanks.Savita

I believe that it is intended to eliminate any confusion that historically arose during the debate between "First Method" (one-way payments) and "Second Method" (two-way payments) for Early Termination purposes.  Although I can t find a good reason to continue to use this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point)  I can understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21  1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of you who have never seen this form  it was one of the two types of master agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because these forms didn t contemplate municipal counterparties  we had to add many of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was included in the "Event of Change" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the ISDA concept of "Illegality"  a "Termination Event").  I think it was probably included because in the ISDA  Second Method is the automatic payment method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early Termination purposes  but there isn t a comparable provision in the old ECT form.

I am the lead contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues for EnronOnline.  I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group (financial  physical  power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and Credit teams.I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from Friday.  Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already trading).   I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions  if any  we might have for financial trading in Australia.  Are there any restricted counterparties  such as governmentals  utilities  banks  dealers  etc.  or any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading financial power  although I m sure the list will expand over time).   Have your GTC s been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?Similarly  I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to trade  and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole range of EnronOnline products.   Are there any provisions we must add to the form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North American product from Australia?  Do we have any tax issues or language we need to cover?  Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and arbitration.  Will that be enforceable in Australia?  Are there any issues we need to address if we require collateral (a guaranty or letter of credit) with respect to a trade?Thanks for your help!
christian.yoder@enron.com,dale.rasmussen@enron.com|karen.jones@enron.com|elizabeth.sager@enron.com|elizabeth.sager@enron.com,Dale and Karen Mark Taylor and a New York lawyer named Ken Rasler (great CFTC speech at legal conference guy) are coming to town as set forth below.  I am trying to get Elizabeth to come up then too but do not yet know her schedule.  For Monday night entertainment I am inviting you both to join the three of us and am wondering if this might be an opportunity to experiment with the bolt to the countryside approach.  I m  tired of these dinners in town and wonder if we might not  be able to plunge forth into Arcadia by picking  them up at 5:30 and  then drive up the gorge or up to timberline lodge or  hell  let s drive out to the coast for dinner  walk on the beach at night.  Anyway   I am open for suggetions and hope you can join us.  ----cgy---------------------- Forwarded by Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT on 02/17/2000 03:07 PM ---------------------------From: Tim Belden on 02/09/2000 08:43 AMTo: Kevin McGowan/HOU/ECT@ECT  Mike Swerzbin/HOU/ECT@ECT  Jeff Richter/HOU/ECT@ECT  Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT  Diana Scholtes/HOU/ECT@ECT  Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECT  Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT  Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT  Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT  Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT  Dana Lee Campbell/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Mark Taylor VisitMark Taylor will be visiting our office on Monday March 6.

I m obviously not able to get back to Houston today as originally planned.  Continental has me booked on a flight on Sunday -- assuming they re back up to full schedule by then -- so I plan to be back in the office on Monday morning.  I will continue to work from the London office and you can reach me at 011-44-207-783-6468 at the office (but I can t get voicemail here) or on the cell phone 011-44-7881-512-535 (where I am able to check messages).  I will also be checking voicemail in Houston from time to time.I know it s hard to think about work issues much less concentrate  but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.  The NYMEX is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions (such as using average of the entire month of NYMEX prices) and then review the relevant documentation.  With any luck there won t be many.  We also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish.I ll be in touch.Mark TaylorVice President and General CounselEnron Wholesale Services(713)853-7459

robin.rodrigue@enron.com,gabriel.monroy@enron.com,So what you re telling me is that you re intentionally trying to bait me.  Apparently you haven t figured out yet that it can be hazardous to your health to make me mad!!  And I know you well enough to know that my last statement will only serve as a challenge to you.  You re going to spend the rest of the day trying to irritate me.  Don t deny it.  I know you too well.  So where are we going to watch the game?  If I understood soccer a little better I d be more involved in the trash-talking.  But I ll just leave it at this...the US could kick Mexico s butt at anything!!  Mexican men can t even knock down an American girl even when they are given 13 whole seconds to try!!

To tell you the truth  the one at 10:00 I was clueless and then I found out I was the one that was supposed to kind of give all the information. (information I of course did not know). It was a good learning experience because we called somebody else that I told them had the information.   Thanks for asking.

phillip.k.ellen@enron.com,john.lavorato@enron.com,Traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip.  Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.As far as the business meetings  I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  My suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski s.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.

jgibson@coloradodlc.org,info@coloradodlc.org,This email is the monthly update for December on the progress of the Colorado Democratic Leadership Council and New Democrat Movement in our state.  The Colorado DLC is a think tank focused on local  state and federal issues of interest to this region.  The New Democrat Update is distributed to more than 3 600 elected officials and private citizens the first week of each month.**REJUVENATING RURAL COLORADO**In the old economy  most rural areas had reasonably strong and stable economic bases to support growth and jobs.  In addition to low costs  plentiful labor and adequate physical infrastructure  rural regions depended on innovative economic activities "filtering down" from urban areas.Clearly  those days are over.  The innovative  well-paying industries increasingly cluster in the metropolitan suburbs  providing minimal economic benefits to rural Colorado.  To date  most rural economies have been largely left out and are having significant difficulty competing and prospering in the New Economy.Rural communities face a new opportunity and challenge to prosper in this new world. The opportunity -  unlike the old economy  new technologies allow economic activity to be geographically farther apart while still functionally tight.  The challenge - much of rural Colorado has limited access to high-speed telecommunications technologies  a critical factor in determining business location and expansion decisions.Federal  state and local governments  in partnership with the private sector  must help rural communities adapt and develop innovative  technology-based economies through seed venture programs  technology-incubators  industry-university research partnerships and collaborative technology modernization projects.  Ideally  nonprofit entrepreneurial organizations  linked to the private sector  should run these initiatives.Much like the digital economy  today s economic strategies take a strong combination of good hardware and software.  The Colorado congressional delegation can help with the "hardware" by pushing for federal funding to co-invest in business applications with rural broadband telecommunications providers.  In addition  they should support Senator Tom Daschle s proposal to provide federal loans to rural utility providers for deployment of broadband telecommunication connections.Growing and prospering in the New Economy also requires the right "software" - in this case  the skills and knowledge of young people.  As a result of an undue reliance on property taxes  many rural school districts experience gross inequities.  The state can become a much better partner by overhauling its antiquated K-12 public school funding system.  While money alone will not solve educational problems  neither will a lack of resources.Innovative private-public partnerships like PowerUP can also help.  With centers that have between 10 and 20 Internet-connected computers  PowerUP provides practical training to young people by getting technology into schools  community centers and other organizations.  The sites are open and welcoming  as well as safe places for young people to spend time.  Staff encourage students to work together  and computers are placed so that supervisors can see what is on each person s monitor at all times.Among PowerUP s notable partners is the Corporation for National Service s AmeriCorps program  which provides young volunteers who  in exchange for help with college tuition  go into communities to set up and help manage the computer centers.  As non-technical users and innovators  these "Digital Brigades" help train local students while implementing technology-based projects that improve and help the community.Colorado state and local governments should partner with the private sector and provide matching funds to spur development of rural technology centers.  The State of Florida has taken that approach  leveraging a relatively modest $500 000 investment and creating 25 computer lab sites across the state.Universities and community colleges can strengthen the competitiveness of rural firms by analyzing the specific needs of local economies and offering consulting services on technology and processes.  Public matching funds for joint university-private sector research can be tied to new product development.Nonprofit corporations  which share technological innovations and identify new product and process opportunities  should be organized.  New technology clearinghouses can provide data on new patents and ideas relevant to local industries.Forming innovative alliances  - as well as leveraging private/public sector funding  leadership  and volunteers - can effectively meet rural Colorado s economic challenges.  We have no time to waste.**CONNECTING TO RURAL COLORADO**To develop a progressive majority coalition  Colorado Democrats must do much in better in rural regions of the state.  Republicans control almost 75 percent of county commissions and Democrats send a very small handful of rural legislators to the State House.  In the last presidential election  Vice President Al Gore lost the rural vote by 20 points.State Democrats at all levels of government can close this gap by closely examining Mark Warner s gubernatorial victory last month in Virginia.  His statewide message - improvements in education and the quality of life would bring "knowledge jobs" to all parts of the state - proved decisive.Just as important  Warner embraced mainstream  values-based positions on cultural issues  realizing that tone matters as well as substance.  Our party can speak about tough issues like gun control and gay rights without implying that no decent and reasonable person can have a different view.  Voters who feel marginalized  even demonized  by hard-left rhetoric will almost certainly retaliate.For many rural voters  the role of government is in part an issue of values. The New Democratic stance on this issue - that government should equip people to solve their own problems - is sure to make significant inroads into the rural electorate.**NEW WORLD  NEW WAR**The November/December issue of Blueprint provides a roadmap on how America can defeat terrorism  grow the economy and ask all Americans to give something back.  This edition includes provocative articles by DLC national Chair Evan Bayh  former President Bill Clinton  Senator Joe Lieberman  and Senator John Kerry.  Other pieces provide insight on modernizing our intelligence services  strategies to defend the country from weapons of mass destruction  beefing up homeland defense  the crisis in the Mideast  reinventing NATO  why Saddam Hussein s Iraq must be the next target and more.You can read Blueprint online by visiting www.coloradodlc.org and clicking on "New World  New War."  It is the first item under What s Up Nationally.  If you would like a hard copy  contact Jim Gibson at jgibson@coloradodlc.org or 303-936-4681.

I also had a telephone conference with Neil and Suzanne of WFW. Below is a summary:1. The C/P was entered into in Singapore by Russell for ECTS. All Petchem C/Ps are arranged by Russell. I am advised that it is at John Nowlan s instructions.2. EPTS (Singapore) Pte Ltd are the Owners  agents. We do not at present know the identity of the Owners. WFW will find out from Lloyd s and relevant ship registers. In any case  the Owners would not know the chain of contracts. They would only know the type of cargo (stated in C/P)  that the supplier is Hyundai Oil  Korea and receiver is Tuntex Petrochemicals (Thailand) Public Company (stated in the voyage orders 10 Sept). 3. By an e-mail dated 16 Sept  EPTS advised of delays at Yantai because the preceding charterers did not have the import licence ready. EPTS claims that they were not aware of the problems at the time of fixing. We do not know of any other reason for the delay.4. Delays at Chinese ports (including Yantai) are  common and typically for a few days (Sheila : 1 - 2 days  Russell : 3 - 4 days).5. The clause "subject to unforeseen delays"  for ETA fixing is not unusual. WFW confirms that it would  in any case  be implied by law and the point is sufficiently supported by case law.6. As regards the reference to "expected ready to load" in Suzanne s opinion of 24 Sept  it appears on the front page of asbatankvoy. WFW advises that the legal effect is the same as ETA and requires the Owners to nominate a date which they reasonable expect to meet. 7. Seok Wah advises that the "expected ready to load" clause is rarely filled in (although not unheard of). She was not able to elaborate on the reasons except that it depends on whether the Owners would agree to it if it is at all requested for. She advsies that the actual asbatankvoy form typically arrives more than a month after the deal. At which time  loading is usually complete. 8. As regards laycan coinciding with loading date range  Russell advises that this particular transaction was exceptional although not unusual. Loading date ranges for Petchem deals are typically wide and laycan would fall within the loading date range with some buffer at both ends. In the present case  loading date range (15 - 20 Sept) was almost the same as laycan (14 - 20 Sept). Consequently  there was no "breathing space".9. "GA/ARB LONDON" and "YA RULES in the C/P stands for "General Average/Arbitration London" and "York Antwerp rules" respectively. I understand the York Antwerp rules deal with General Average. In the absence of an express provision  the arbitral rules would be the general provisions of the UK Arbitration Act (1966).10. Sheila now advises that the difference in price (including freight) between buying from Hyundai and Enron Petrochemicals (Europe) Company (the alternative source) is USD228 000. The difference in freight alone is USD87 000. Notably  however  the quality description of the product is amended in the supply contract to Tuntex.11. Neil s advice:(i) Agree entirely with Suzanne s advice. An action against Hyundai is speculative at best. A more realistic action exists against the Owners. I conveyed the answers to questions posed by Suzanne in her opinion. WFW had no further questions at present.(ii) Further explored the issue of whether the Clause "Default  Termination and Liquidation" in the Hyundai trade confirmation :-  whether the definition of "Default" which includes "a material breach" not cured within 10 business days may be construed as an expressed cure period for a breach of loading date range. Neil does not think that it can and loading date range would still be construed as a condition a breach of which entitles termination by the non-defaulting party. (iii) The duty of "reasonable despatch" is continuing and applies for each revised ETA advised by the Owners. Attached for your comments is an executive summary of WFW s opinion based on Suzanne s opinion dated 24 September 1999 and our telephone discussions today.RegardsMatt

Britt Davis@ENRON 02/02/2001 10:08 AM      To: Andrew Edison/NA/Enron@Enron   cc: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT  Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT  Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT@ECT  Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject: ENA v. TriadAndy This is basically a collection action for about $1 800 000 of unpaid spot gas sales against Triad  a very small company whose address (or at least one address) is in Columbus  Maryland.   The unpaid sales deals began around February of 2000.  All the deals were made over the phone by the trader  and then confirmed with ENA s spot gas sales forms ("confirms").  Per ENA s usual custom and practice  neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms  although there are signature lines.  ENA scheduled the gas due for all of these deals.  Triad paid off some other deals  but has since stopped sending us any money.  I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February 2000.  Triad s principal  Sherwood Purnell  has apparently admitted in a recorded telephone conference that he would pay us.  Our information is that Triad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else.Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms  we have sent an arbitration demand to Triad.  Triad did not respond.  The AAA has sent out a list of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February 7.  I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and an extension for Purnell  and left a message that I want to discuss the case.  This was on Monday.  I have also had  Becky  my legal assistant  call up Triad s registered agent for service of process  although the Maryland secretary of state s office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing.  The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and told Becky (a) he was still the right party to receive service of process and (b) he was "aware of us".  This leads me to believe that the address that we have been using is a good address.  We did get someone to sign for documents that we sent to that address.  What I don t want to do  however   is go all the way through arbitration  get a default judgment  then  when we try to enforce it  have Triad complain that we sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address.My plan is to ask the AAA for a fifteen-day extension of time within which to send our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and any other address that looks viable  by Federal Express or certified mail  so that we get a receipt.  So long as we get the registered agent to sign for these things  I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding.   Giving Triad an extension of time to answer also makes us look good. Parenthetically  unfortunately  given Triad s attitude  I think it likely that after we get an arbitration award  Triad will choose not to abide by it until  at a minimum  we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the award enforced.  I don t see a way around that problem.Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time.BrittThanks.Britt

stuart.fieldhouse@enron.com,richard.b.sanders@enron.com|robert.knight@enron.com|lance.jameson@enron.com|robert.knight@enron.com|lance.jameson@enron.com,RichardFollowing our meeting I have been discussing the voice recording requirements with other members of the project team  and I need to correct one piece of information I supplied to you. Regarding the recording of internal calls  it is possible to not record calls made on the Lucent digital phones internally  but ALL calls made on turrets (the phones the traders use) would have to be recorded  whether internal or external. This is due to the way in which the voice recording system must be connected to the turret system. Therefore  could you assume when considering what the corporate requirements are that we cannot exclude internal calls. My apologies for this mistake  we are going to investigate the development of a solution to this problem with the vendors under consideration. I will keep you in touch with all progress that is made.

Gray Davis wi=ll announce a plan to relieve California s overloaded electricity grid this= summer by paying businesses to run their high-polluting backup generators =in advance of anticipated blackouts  a top energy adviser to the governor s=aid Wednesday.  "The backup generators will help us get through the summer =" said S. David Freeman  who recently resigned as general manager of the Lo=s Angeles Department of Water and Power to lead Davis  drive for energy con=servation.  Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of =the plan.  "The governor will announce what he s going to do " he said Wedn=esday in a wide-ranging interview on energy issues with The Bee.  Roger Sal=azar  the governor s deputy press secretary  would not confirm when or whet=her Davis would make such an announcement.  "I don t know that the governor= has signed off on anything like that " Salazar said.  Under the plan  part=icipating businesses would turn on backup generators and simultaneously dis=connect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at Stage 3 -- nea=rly depleted.  The state would pay the companies for the much-needed power =that would be saved by converting to diesel generation.  Deploying diesel-p=owered generators -- the dirtiest of internal combustion engines -- to fore=stall blackouts is another sign of the governor s struggle to get more mega=watts flowing through California.  Earlier this week Davis lowered his esti=mate of the amount of new power that will come on line this summer from 5 0=00 megawatts to 4 000 megawatts. A megawatt is enough power for 750 to 1 00=0 households.  The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Da=vis administration s policy.  The governor and his appointees at the state =Air Resources Board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries = utilities and the operator of the state s electricity grid  arguing that r=outine use of the backup diesels would endanger public health.  San Diego G=as & Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by the Davis=-appointed state Public Utilities Commission.  Environmentalists who have b=een catching word of the Davis plan this week argue that it would shatter t=he governor s repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards duri=ng the energy crisis.  A letter signed Wednesday by several of the state s =leading environmental organizations  including the American Lung Associatio=n of California  urged Davis to reconsider.  "Given your awareness of the p=ublic health threats of diesel emissions  please stop and have these propos=als considered in a more thoughtful and public manner " the letter states. = Freeman argued  however  that the additional health threat from non-emerge=ncy use of diesel generators is "marginal" compared with the health and saf=ety problems triggered by power outages.  "This is a no-brainer " Freeman s=aid. "You ve got human lives at stake here. This is a scary situation."  Fr=eeman cited  for example  people on life-support systems that could go awry= in blackouts.  But Sandra Spelliscy  attorney for the environmentalist Pla=nning and Conservation League  countered  "If the health impacts are so mar=ginal  why has the governor s own air quality enforcement agency opposed th=is?"  Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data =management centers have diesel-powered generators -- some the size of locom=otives -- that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power.  Unlike= diesel-powered trucks and buses  most diesel standby generators run with l=ittle or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergenci=es.  Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently  most genera=tors in use today produce about 500 times more emissions of smog-forming ni=trogen oxides per megawatt-hour as a new natural gas-fired power plant  acc=ording to air board engineers. Further  the diesels spew high amounts of br=eathable soot particles that can cause cancer  the engineers say.  Davis  p=lan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator de=clares a Stage 3 alert  meaning the power supplies are running low and roll=ing blackouts may be ordered to keep the state s entire grid from collapsin=g  according to Freeman.  Salazar  the governor s spokesman  said only  "An=y backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort =to prevent blackouts."  Environmentalists who are trying to head off the pl=an said it would have the state paying participating businesses at least 35= cents per kilowatt-hour  roughly three times the rate consumers typically =pay for electricity. Freeman would not confirm the pay rate.  The Davis adm=inistration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to= the state 50 percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need= to comply with smog rules.  For operators of existing power plants  the go=vernor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above =allowable limits in order to keep the lights on.  The latest plan to pay co=mpanies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the e=nvironmental reins.

Gray Davis to talk about California s worsening electricity =crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly =favors some controls on West Coast wholesale electricity prices.  Details f=or the Bush-Davis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday  but the fa=ct that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic governor  w=ho is often mentioned as a possible challenger in 2004  was seen as a sign =that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the energy issu=e.  "California is a very big state " said White House spokesman Ari Fleisc=her. "It represents one-sixth of the United States. It s the sixth-largest =economy in the world. And the president is very pleased to sit and talk wit=h Governor Davis. It s important."  Davis  spokesman  Steve Maviglio  said =electricity price caps will be at the top of the governor s agenda for the =meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. But Fleischer did not commit the president= to that kind of meeting.  In his first visit to the state since the campai=gn last year  the president will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tues=day night in Fresno.  Until now  the White House has steadfastly refused to= meet with any elected Democrat from California about the energy crisis des=pite repeated pleas from the Democratic congressional delegation.  Price co=ntrols have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers and a hand=ful of Republicans  but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed them a=s counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawatt-short st=ate.  In recent weeks  however  there has been a developing shift in the at=titude toward price controls on Capitol Hill. Bush s two nominees to the Fe=deral Energy Regulatory Commission  whose names were forwarded to the Senat=e floor Wednesday for confirmation  declined to rule out price controls onc=e they are seated on the panel.  And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen. =James Jeffords to abandon the Republican Party would put Democrats in contr=ol of the Senate  moving Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico  a price-control =advocate  to the helm of the key Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commit=tee.  California Sen. Dianne Feinstein  a committee Democrat  said Wednesda=y that she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legis=lation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production.  Four= Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of p=rice-control legislation.  On Wednesday  Rep. Doug Ose  R-Sacramento  annou=nced that he is introducing a bill that  while not technically a price cap = would give greater price relief for West Coast consumers than federal regu=lators or the Bush administration have been willing to offer.  Ose  chairma=n of the House Government Reform Committee s energy subcommittee  said his =bill would extend throughout the West a price-mitigation plan approved last= month by the FERC. But instead of that plan taking effect only during powe=r emergencies as the commission directed  it would operate around the clock= under Ose s bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of th=e least-efficient plant selling into the California market.  Ose said his b=ill would encourage generators to sell their power through long-term contra=cts rather than on the volatile spot market.  "I am looking for a middle gr=ound " Ose said.

The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and v=ote along party lines on an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis  proposed $2.76 =billion state purchase of power lines.  Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox= of Fair Oaks said Wednesday s split was necessary because there are few di=fferences between the governor s plan and the Democrats  plan.  The Republi=can plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectr=ic facilities.  Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer ra=tes to allow Edison to pay off $3.5 billion in debts. In return  ratepayers= would receive either an equity stake in future power plants or the right t=o purchase electricity at discount rates.=09Few escape blame for crisis in poll By Dan Smith Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau =Chief (Published May 24  2001)  Utility companies and out-of-state power ge=nerators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in Californ=ia s energy crisis  but Gov. Gray Davis  grades have slipped dramatically o=ver the past five months  according to a Field Poll released Wednesday.  An=d Californians  it turns out  blame plenty of people for the state s power =woes -- except themselves.  Every player in the power drama gets poor marks= except "residential energy consumers " which 39 percent of poll respondent=s say are doing a good or very good job to improve the energy situation. On=ly 22 percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job.  Public opinion= of residential consumers  efforts has improved since January  when 32 perc=ent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave them high m=arks.  "The public sees themselves as conserving energy " said Field Poll D=irector Mark DiCamillo. "That s the only positive movement in the survey." = For Davis  who faces re-election next year  the movement is far from posit=ive.  In the January poll  the Democratic governor received good marks from= 41 percent of those surveyed  average grades from 31 percent and poor rati=ngs from only 22 percent.  But when the Field Institute conducted its recen=t poll between May 11 and Sunday  opinions about Davis flip-flopped. After =months of energy angst  a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases=  only 27 percent think Davis is doing a good job  while 38 percent gave hi=m failing grades. The poll also shows that Californians believe the crisis =will continue by an average of a year and a half  well through the upcoming= re-election battle.  "All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effec=t early on is not going over well any more " DiCamillo said. "The public is= starting to view this as a long-term problem  not some temporary policy sh=ift."  Still  Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis -- =President Bush  Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry.  The pu=blic s view of energy interests  which was pretty dim in January  drops eve=n lower in the May poll. Utility companies received bad ratings from half t=he public in January  but 57 percent now believe they are doing a poor or v=ery poor job. Out-of-state energy generators  whom Davis has accused of gou=ging ratepayers  fell from 44 percent low ratings in January to 55 percent =in the May poll.  Bush  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the st=ate Public Utilities Commission are not far behind  drawing poor grades fro=m more than half the public. Cheney  the architect of Bush s energy proposa=l  received low ratings from 43 percent. The January Field Poll did not ask= about Bush and Cheney because they had not yet taken office.  Davis has re=peatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity  =and has called Cheney "grossly misinformed" on the state s energy problems.= Cheney  in turn  has called Davis  energy proposals "harebrained" and "goo=fy."  The state Legislature receives poor marks from 41 percent of those po=lled  while only 16 percent believe it is doing a good job.

That s the gro=wing sentiment among a range of elected officials  including Gov. Gray Davi=s  who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving business=es and residents ample warning.  On Tuesday  the Democratic governor s offi=ce said Davis supports longer public notice than the 24 hours called for un=der a proposal by the California Independent System Operator  which runs th=e state s power grid.  Assemblyman Mike Briggs  R-Fresno  introduced a bill= that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could ma=ke plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all oth=er days the lights would stay on.  Briggs called his plan an improvement on= the existing system in which "every day is a potential blackout day."  A S=enate committee  meanwhile  discussed planned blackouts as part of a strate=gy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state= will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask Washing=ton and Oregon to join the so-called "buyers  cartel."  If the power genera=tors refused to sell at the lower prices  the state would gut it out with p=lanned blackouts.  "Let s use the blackouts against the generators " Michae=l Shames  head of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers  Action Network  to=ld the Energy  Utilities and Communications Committee. But Shames and other=s stressed the need for warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no long=er than 90 minutes.  "Absent that management of blackouts  we don t see how= the buyers  cartel could work " Shames said.  On a visit to Chicago on Mon=day  Davis said he talked to officials about the city s system for giving t=he public warning days before possible power blackouts  with definite notic=e right before.  "There is no reason to keep that secret from the public wh=en their safety is likely to be jeopardized " Davis told reporters Tuesday.= The governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at I=SO to explore the idea of a system like Chicago s.  The grid operator annou=nced Monday that it will try to give the public at least a half-hour notice= of outages  but many officials said Tuesday the public needs even more war=ning. Davis aides said the governor s plan will go beyond ISO s.  There are= potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans  taking advantage= of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts might inc=rease the number of outages.  If people have been warned that a blackout is= coming  and a last-minute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary  grid= managers would have to decide whether to call it off  said Dorothy Rothroc=k  vice president of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association.=  If they did  it would add uncertainty to future warnings  she said  possi=bly leading them to order unnecessary blackouts.  "Obviously  there are tra=de-offs " Rothrock said.  Still  the idea of planning blackouts seems to be= gaining ground as a way for the state to get back some control of the ener=gy crisis  sorely lacking in recent months.  "It would help us as Californi=ans to say   The hell with you  George Bush  we re going to handle this our=selves   " said Jim Overman  68  of Elk Grove.  Overman said he has been bu=rning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone who will listen that sch=eduled blackouts will make everyone s lives easier.  Briggs said he has bee=n told by constituents  including irrigators and food processors  that sche=duled blackouts are the way to go.  Irrigators would know that they shouldn= t plan on getting water on a day that their electronic gates might be clos=ed.  Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day  or arran=ge for backup power generators  he said.  "We would be very interested in i=t " said Ed Yates  senior vice president of the California League of Food P=rocessors.  Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants  Yates said  =requiring some plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for =more than a day.  Some processors might choose to close on days when they f=aced a blackout  he said  losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands= of pounds of food.  "It doesn t solve the problem  but it helps manage a v=ery difficult situation " he said.  Briggs said that his plan would result =in possible blackout days every two weeks. The plan would assume that a cer=tain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operatin=g. If the electricity shortage went above that amount  people might still f=ace unanticipated blackouts  Briggs said.  One question is public safety. S=ome are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur. But pluses= include the ability to arrange for temporary stop signs at road intersecti=ons  or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved.  "I=f the police have only five minutes notice  they can t get to difficult int=ersections to direct traffic  they can t help paramedics  fire departments =and ambulances get where they have to be " Davis said.  The manufacturers  =association and other business groups haven t endorsed the idea yet  but sa=y it s worth a look.  "It s preferable to random  rolling blackouts " Rothr=ock said.

And  according to a Field Poll released Tuesday  they re not= so hot on the recently approved $13.4 billion bond authorization to pay fo=r electricity  or the idea of Gov. Gray Davis seizing power plants through =eminent domain.  Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by =respondents  unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes =of the state s power woes. Nearly 60 percent said it essentially is an arti=ficial crisis created by power companies to make money.  But on one longsta=nding issue -- nuclear power -- the poll showed a clear preference and a dr=amatic shift in public opinion.  In the highest recorded support for nuclea=r power in California since before the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979  =59 percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide elect=ricity.  Support among registered voters grows to 61 percent  with 33 perce=nt opposed. Among Democrats  53 percent support more nuclear plants  and th=ree-fourths of Republicans and 55 percent of others agree.  "The change in =attitude is very significant because they know this issue " Field Poll Dire=ctor Mark DiCamillo said.  Californians  support for nuclear power reached =nearly 70 percent in the mid-1970s in the aftermath of a nationwide energy =crisis. But it plummeted to 37 percent in 1979 after the partial meltdown a=t Pennsylvania s Three Mile Island plant and fell to 33 percent in 1984 -- =the last time Field surveyed the question.  In 1989  voters demanded that t=he Sacramento Municipal Utility District s Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shu=t down. The utility complied and has spent more than $200 million decommiss=ioning it during the past 12 years.  Although the poll results are in line =with some private surveys done recently by nuclear-energy advocates  oppone=nts say the Field Poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has b=een dormant for so long. Not since the late  70s has an application for a n=uclear plant been filed in the United States. Only two operate in Californi=a -- San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo Canyon in San Luis Obispo.  ="When the (poll) questions are on issues that people haven t thought about =that much lately  you do get some aberrant results " said Bill Magavern  a =lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "People right now are obviously concerned abo=ut electricity  but they haven t really thought about what it would be like= to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood."  The Field Poll result=s lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently =released by President Bush  who called for more nuclear power plants nation=wide.  But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energ=y Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despi=te opposition from the Bush administration. The poll showed 70 percent of a=ll adults and 68 percent of registered voters -- including 57 percent of Bu=sh s fellow Republicans -- support the price controls.  "It really does exp=ose the Bush administration to long-term serious problems in California if =they re perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard " DiCamil=lo said. "The public really thinks (price caps) should be imposed."  Republ=icans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition  and Democra=ts narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to authorize =the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases.  Amon=g all adults  38 percent approve of the move  and 52 percent oppose it. Dem=ocrats disapprove of the bonds by a 46 percent to 44 percent margin.  Calif=ornians  desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy crunch=  respondents said.  By a margin of 51 percent to 41 percent  poll responde=nts say they would maintain air-quality standards rather than relax them to= build plants. That support is down from a Field survey in January  when 59= percent said they d rather maintain standards. Moreover  a majority (53 pe=rcent) say they would relax air-quality standards to get older plants back =in operation  an increase from 47 percent in January.  Slight majorities su=pport a state-run public power authority (54 percent) and state-owned power= transmission lines (51 percent)  but DiCamillo said that some poll respond=ents were probably not familiar with all the implications of those moves.  =Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to r=ise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines  with Democrats in favor = 50 percent to 42 percent  and Republicans opposed  52 percent to 32 percen=t. Overall  the idea was rejected by 48 percent of adults and favored by 44= percent.  A strong majority of registered voters  56 percent  oppose addit=ional offshore oil and gas drilling to ease the energy crunch  and 38 perce=nt favor it.

A natural gas advisory panel is set to= unveil a 56-page report looking at whether moratoriums on offshore oil and= gas development should be lifted. It will also name specific sites for pos=sible drilling.  Rep. Anna Eschoo  D-Palo Alto  said Tuesday that if the Bu=sh administration tries to undo moratoriums protecting more than 170 millio=n acres off the California coast  it would be like "targeting a missile at =us."  So far  the Bush administration hasn t taken any direct action. The e=nergy policy he released last week calls for more oil and gas development  =but its only recommendation about offshore drilling was that the secretarie=s of interior and commerce re-examine current laws and executive orders "to= determine if changes are needed."  Today s report is to urge selection of =five of the most promising gas prospects in offshore areas covered by morat=oriums in a pilot program aimed at eventual drilling.

Gray= Davis.  White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday= that the state s energy crisis will be "at the top of the list" when the p=resident and the governor meet. The president s aides said that the time an=d place for the meeting are still being worked out.  Bush s visit to the st=ate will be his first since last fall s campaign. With their party enjoying= only a slim majority in the U.S. House  some California Republicans have e=xpressed dismay over their state s absence from the president s extensive p=ost-inaugural travel schedule  fearing that the energy crisis could cost so=me GOP lawmakers their seats in next year s elections. =09Fleischer s announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphas=is on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no h=int until then that the president would address the issue during his upcomi=ng trip to California.  However  Davis called the White House on Tuesday ni=ght proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy. = He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quick=er action on the energy front: "Californians can t afford to wait four or f=ive years for a permanent solution. We need relief today."  In the longer o=f two letters  Davis wrote: "You and I don t agree on everything. But here =s something we do have in common: we both inherited an energy mess. And the= people that elected us expect us to clean it up."  Davis also offered in t=he letters to "introduce" Bush to "business owners and everyday citizens wh=o have been personally affected by this energy crisis."  Fleischer said Wed=nesday that Bush would meet with "business leaders and energy consumers."  =Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis  Fleischer suggested the preside=nt s schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis  suggestions.  "This= is a case of they both want to meet with each other  and we re very please=d to be able to make it work out " he said.  As for the meeting with the bu=siness leaders  Fleischer said  "The president has several events on his sc=hedule that already include business leaders and energy consumers  and so i=t very well may happen that we re each suggesting similar things  which wou=ld be a healthy sign."  Bush s itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at= the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base designed to showcase his order direct=ing the military to cut their energy use by 10 percent at California facili=ties.  Fleischer said that the president wanted "to talk about how the fede=ral government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California i=n the cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as= they go through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are mo=st at risk."  The White House released an outline of the president s Califo=rnia itinerary on Tuesday afternoon. It indicated that the visit would not =give prominent attention to the state s energy woes.  Fleischer declined to= say whether the president would expand on his energy plan in any way while= in California.  Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply cri=tical of the Bush administration for failing to take decisive action to hel=p alleviate the electricity shortage s toll on the state and its citizens. = They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before =the House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in= the state. The administration and most of the state s Republican lawmakers= oppose the measure.  Last week  Bush showcased an administration task forc=e report on the nation s energy challenges that stressed long-range solutio=ns focused mainly on increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded =role for nuclear power. The report also suggested incentives to encourage e=nergy conservation and greater fuel efficiency.  Bush s trip will begin on =Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in Arizona to Los Angeles wh=ere he will spend the night. He will return to Washington on Wednesday nigh=t after a visit to the Fresno area.  Bush assumed office despite losing the= nation s most populous state by a decisive margin and then launched into t=he most ambitious travel schedule of any modern president.

"Since there s a window of opportunity here because of the need in Cali=fornia for electricity  anyone who requests a permit will get it " Martens =said after speaking at the Institute of the Americas  10th annual Latin Ame=rican Energy Conference in La Jolla.  Power plant construction in Baja Cali=fornia has become one of the most immediate solutions to California s elect=ricity shortfalls. At least three plants being built in Baja California in =the next four years will send electricity north of the border  where blacko=uts have interrupted normal activity.  One facility  a Sempra Energy Corp. =power plant near Mexicali  will export all of its electrical output to cons=umers north of the border. The San Diego company s project gained quick app=roval from Mexican authorities because the facility is not subject to restr=ictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the Mexican= market.  Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprise=s are interested in building similar facilities in Baja California.  Such a= mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border t=hat the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public h=ealth and safety.  In his speech  Martens emphasized Mexico s commitment to= preserving the environment and local communities.  But afterward  he said =Mexico will approve any number of Baja California projects to serve Califor=nia consumers.  "I don t see any limit. The only limit is the ability of th=e interconnecting lines to transmit the electricity that is produced " he s=aid.  With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each  the two transmission inte=rconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja Californi=a will not be able to transmit all of the 1 500 megawatts of electricity fo=r the California market produced by the new Baja California plants -- let a=lone any additional facilities.  Sempra  whose San Diego Gas & Electric sub=sidiary owns both the interconnecting lines  plans to upgrade the interconn=ector near Mexicali  spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvemen=t will transmit electricity from Sempra s plant in Baja California to the c=ompany substation in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego =and Tijuana.  Clark said he doesn t know how the other companies building B=aja California plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives o=f the firms could not be reached yesterday.  Even if the companies find a w=ay to send electricity across the border  the California grid system presen=ts another obstacle.  To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the= Southern California grid  the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing wh=at capacity it has for transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess= tariffs for the service.  "It s become very important because of our proxi=mity to Mexico " said district spokesman Ron Hull.  The ability to transmit= electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in Baja Californ=ia. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities.  Sempra again is= a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja Pipeline that wi=ll supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in Baja Califor=nia and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego. The pipeline won t provi=de fuel for any other facilities.  "It s fully subscribed " said Clark. "In= the future if there is enough demand  the compression could be increased."=  Energy Secretary Martens  however  hinted at the possibility of new natur=al gas supplies in Baja California. He said Mexico wants liquified natural =gas facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada.  While several c=ompanies have expressed an interest in such an operation  Martens  comments= were the first to indicate that two  and not one  might be approved for Ba=ja California. =09Potential governor candidate launches Northern California tour=20ALEXA HAUSSLER  Associated Press WriterThursday  May 24  2001=20?2001 Associated Press=20URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=3D/news/archive/2001/05=/24/state1726EDT0229.DTL&type=3Dnews =20(05-24) 00:01 PDT LIVERMORE  Calif.

He warned me not to expect 6 weeks  as that timewas required to negotiate and produce a protective order/confidentialityagreement with the generators who received the first subpoenas.  He didacknowledge that an extension was required  but made two points:  first that the staff is under tremendous pressure to hurry its investigation  andsecondly  that providing a partial response to requests that can beaccomodated quickly will be greatly appreciated "as a show of good faith".He also indicated that the most recent batch of subpoenas went to almost 120parties.I will try to get as much of the 6 weeks as I can.  It would assist me ifrepresentatives of EES and EPMI could scan the requests to see if  in fact there are items which could be provided in a shorter time frame and whichwould not raise concerns about the disclosure of commercially sensitiveinformation.  I would like to be able to bargain for more time by offeringsome information in the near term....if the strategy is to be give what wecan and strongly resist the most sensitive information.Mike Day

Enron Development Corp. (269th Judicial District Court  Harris County)PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION This morning I received a copy of the Summons  Petition and Request for Disclosure filed in the above-referenced case.  I have had a copy put on your desk. The CT Service of Process Transmittal Form indicates that Enron was served on January 4.  By my calculations  Enron s answer is due on January 29.  The petition generally alleges that the plaintiff entered into a contract with Empressa Electrica de Guatemala  S.A  involving barges in the port of Puerto Quetzal in Guatemala.  Plaintiff further alleges that Enron assumed the plaintiff s position in this contract  expanded the project and failed to pay the pro rata amount allegedly due to plaintiff because of the expansion.  I think you had been working on a dispute involving Texas Ohio Power s claims pertaining to the Empressa PPA  the barges in Guatemala and expansions of that deal.  Is this lawsuit directly related?  If it s not directly related  is it related enough for us to use the same outside firm we used in the TOP dispute?  What outside counsel were we using for the Texas Ohio Power dispute?  Is this something you have time to work on?  If not  let me know and I ll be happy to handle it.  Thanks.

The existing imbalances as of the effective date of the tariff OBA will have to be individually negotiated with the party to resolve separate and apart from any imbalance that occurs under the new OBA.  TW s tariff states that if the OBA party does not execute/sign the tariff OBA  they are still subject to the tariff OBA if they physically receive or deliver gas into/out of Transwestern s system. These relationships will have to be managed carefully from all sides to resolve the old imbalances while moving forward with the tariff OBA for new imbalances.

lippmanc@aol.com,lippmanc@aol.com,RE: GULF COAST 3rd QUARTERLY PRODUCTION REPORTLippman Consulting  Inc. is pleased to announce that it has just completed the 3rd quarterly of 2001 production report for the Gulf Coast Region.  This report contains numerous charts and graphs as well as extensive text depicting the historical volumes produced from this region through the third quarter of 2001.  This report analyzes the production in various ways so that the reader can obtain a complete understanding of the supplies contained in this dynamic region. This is truly a bottoms up report.  Lippman Consulting is currently publishing twelve separate monthly reports covering each of the area s specific regions that make up the Gulf Coast.  Extensive detailed data is contained in each of those reports. This quarterly report  which compiles the data for each of those area reports  is intended to be a summary report for our clients that do not want that level of detail but want to be advised on the overall Gulf volumes. The Gulf Coast region contains almost 50% of the domestic production and therefore is very important to the overall national gas markets. The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the report can be purchased on a one-time basis for $450. If you would like additional information or to order this report  please feel free to contact me by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.George Lippman PresidentLippman Consulting  Inc.

L.D. Stephens - Team Leader/Operations Larry Campbell - Environmental ???????? - ROW (To be determined by Johnny McGee and communicated directly to you) Mike Ames - Pipeline SafetyAs discussed  these employees will arrive in Salt Lake  Sunday evening  October 28th prepared to go to the data room Monday 29th and Tuesday 30th.  They will return to their respective home locations Wednesday morning  October 31st.Please provide a Questar contact person and address of the data room.  If you could also provide the name of a hotel close to the data room  it would be appreciated.Names of other Enron parties participating in the due diligence and where they are staying would be helpful.  Any specific limitations imposed upon the data room reviewshould be communicated as soon as possible.Morris Brassfield (Operations Support) and Jerry Martin (E&C) have determined that it is not necessary for them to have personnel attend the data room.  The operations team will retrieve as much information as possible to support their needs.  It was also my understanding no one from Planning and System Optimization would participate.As I will be out of town the rest of the week  please communicate directly with these individuals via e mail.  If you need to need to contact me  I can be reached at 713-303-2764.Don

Bob has been with the EC for many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny issues.  Clearly  his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and efforts of committee members such as Bob  and the willingness of SoCal Gas to support Bob s participation in our organization.The LDC segment ran its election and voted to support Rodger Swenke  Senior Pipeline Products Project Manager  SoCal Gas  to take the open seat on the EC.  Please join me in welcoming Rodger to our committee; and thanking Bob for all his efforts and wishing him well in his new job assignments with SoCal Gas.

Under FERC s regulations  as of the date of the agreement  Enron and Dynegy must conduct themselves as if they are already merged.  Therefore  Enron can no longer enter into transactions with Illinois Power to buy or sell power absent FERC approval under section 205 of the Federal Power Act  and Dynegy cannot enter into transactions with Portland General absent prior FERC approval.  With regard to the sale and purchase of non-power goods and services  all non-power goods and services provided by Illinois Power to Enron must be priced at the higher of cost or market. Any non-power goods or services provided by Enron to IP must be priced at a level that does not exceed market price.We will work with the attorneys to make these filings  but we wanted you to know as soon as possible that we need to stop power sales and purchases with Illinois Power (if we were doing any) and can only enter into transactions with them with prior FERC approval.We will send a draft of the FERC filing to you for review.  Please let us know if this restriction causes problems for you (e.g.  you have existing or forward contracts with IP that are in effect or are scheduled to go into effect during the pendency of the acquisition).Let us know if you have any questions.Sarah

The proposed standard is not implemented until the modification is made.  (In some cases  a proposed standard takes effect automatically if FERC fails to act on the proposed standard within a specified period of time.)At the GISB - EPSA meeting last Thurs  the GISB people clearly stated that GISB has NO authority over its members  it is 100% voluntary.  All the muscle lies in FERC and any governmental agency that is willing to adopt the GISB standard.  Agencies in Mexico for example have adopted certain GISB standards.  In fact  ANSI acreditaion requires that the standards setting organization NOT to have authority.  So it makes sense for FERC to not amend a proposed standard since other agencies will have to be able to adopt it.(e.g.- Canada)  I don t see a problem with this - but this makes the consensus building process even more important since the final product must be amenable to any and all relevant governement authorities.  This is a good reason why the legislation cannot give deference to the ERO  especially one which proposes to have compliance and enforcement authority as NERC s proposal.  If NERC is going to set standards AND have compliance authority over its members - then the ANSI acreditation they claim to be getting will not be the same as that of GISB.  ANSI does not allow this combination.  If the deference language is in the legislation - that means the GISB/EISB proposal is excluded from FERC s choice.  FERC needs to be aware of this.  So why does the voluntary GISB process with FERC oversight model work? It is the very nature of knowing FERC has final authority that makes the consensus building process work - not the threat of the ERO s compliance authority over its members as NERC approaches this.  In GISB  the  members know that if they do not produce a standard that all its members and FERC can live with - FERC will not adopt it  nor can FERC amend it - and since no enforcement mechanism will be behind the mis-guided standard (remember it is 100% voluntary)  it becomes a worthless exercise.  This is a powerful incentive.   On the other hand  NERC s approach of a standards organization with enforcement power sets the stage for power struggles between sectors and knocks down the consensus building attitude the GISB process encourages.   Compliance and penalites are not assigned or targeted to every member/sector.  Certain parties are impacted by certain standards - and in different ways. For example - a congestion management standard will affect a control area very differently than it would a power marketer.  The penalites may not apply at all to the marketers who want to protect themselves by making the congestion management penalites as harsh as possible and vice versa for the control areas.  If the ERO doles out compliance without FERC approval - then the standards will become a battleground over compliance and penalties. The point is the enforcement and penalty debate will drive sector arguments and will cloud the real task of developing an equitable congestion management standard. -----Original Message-----From:  Shelk  John  Sent: Friday  August 10  2001 3:58 PMTo: Shapiro  Richard; Robertson  Linda; Steffes  James D.; Novosel  Sarah; Yeung  Charles; Perrino  Dave; Rodriquez  Andy; Ingersoll  Richard; Nicolay  Christi L.; Lindberg  Susan; Walton  SteveSubject: Summary of "Final Draft" of NERC "Electric Reliability Organization" LegislationAttached is a summary I did of the key points in the Final Draft of the NERC reliability legislation  as amended yesterday.

Seab said that they are not set up to do a detailed modeling analysis  but that Tabors has the programs already set up and could probably do some type of a modeling analysis.  However  we discussed what other type of study we could do  and we came up with a few ideas.Seab said that there are general benefits to RTO formation:  e.g.  transmission expansion (although you still have siting problems  RTOs will build new transmission where it is needed); administrative cost savings; savings from reserve sharing.  We also discussed the arguments of the cheap power states.  For example  many of the southeastern states oppose RTOs because they fear losing their low cost power.  But Seab points out that RTOs do not mean that the states "lose" their low cost power.  The PSCs retain their authority to decide whether their utilities can or cannot sell power from their plants to third parties.  The PSCs can prohibit utilities from exporting low cost power if it is needed to serve local retail customers.  Seab thought this response to a potential "cost" of RTOs could also be worked into the analysis.Seab and Kevin are going to give the issue more thought and put together a proposal.  The problem is timing.  Seab has California testimony due on November 6 and he expects to be tied up with that for the next 2 weeks.  If we use the cost/benefit study as part of our NOPR comments (due end of Nov - mid Dec)  then he will have enough time.  If we want to present a study before that time (perhaps with comments on RTO week)  he will not be able to do the work.  Seab will have a proposal by COB tomorrow or perhaps Monday morning.I have a call in to Tabors to discuss the same proposal with him.Larry Ruff is on vacation this week.  He s back on Monday.  We can call him then.Rick  you also named a few other people:  Charles Stallon  Eric Wolchek  the Brattle Group.  Should I put calls in to these people as well?

I have been an instrumental part in pushing for the formation of the wholesale electric quadrant of EISB.  Although I have not committed to making a presentation at this workshop  there was a possibility that I would be speaking on behalf of EPSA.  The meeting is a critical juncture for the EISB vs NERC showdown.   NERC will likely present its latest restructuring proposal which includes a 9 sector model.  I and other EPSA members have been advocating much fewer sectors for EISB.  A key point of the NERC proposal is that it may be able to accomodate an EISB approval process for standards.  This is imporatant in that it may be able to resolve the dichotomy between NERC expertise/infrastructure and EISB s reknowned (including FERC) consensus building process.  NERC could retain its standards development expertise  however  lose its biased voting process.I think it is important to have coverage for this meeting  either  by someone on the NERC team or someone close to NERC in Washington.  The likely outcome of this meeting is a solidifying of industry support for either the NERC approach  or a clean slate EISB approach.Jim would like for us to have a conference call to discuss.

He isnot optimistic that any of these issues will be resolved to theChamber s satisfaction.  The Gov s folks truly believe that thesuccessful bond issuance depends upon an end to direct access.  Even ifBowen gets cooperation on her legislation   Allan believes she doesn treally want to do it and is not sure she can get a signature.  I toldhim that Burton said he would sign off on a direct access bill if Bowenagrees to it.  That gave him little encouragement because he doesn t seemuch motivation for Bowen to press on the Governor and Angelides.Allan s view corresponds with everyone we ve spoken to whobelieve thatnothing major will happen legislatively.  A subsequent conversation withHertzberg s office confirms that they feel unable to move an energyagenda at this time  although they have not given up.

Please refer to the attached file for further information.          It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.        Thank you in advance for your assistance.

darla.saucier@enron.com,frank.ermis@enron.com,Hi Frank Just thought I d send you an email to give you the details we discussed today.  We bought 51 042 mmbtu from Puget Sound in May 2001 at Kingsgate.  They seem to think that they bought part/most of that gas back from us at Kingsgate.  However  I do not see a deal showing this purchase from Puget.  Can you ck to see if you did in fact sell this gas back to Puget?  The sitara # of the purchase from Puget is 623949.Let me know if you need anything else from me.  Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.ThanksDarla Saucier3-4561

I think these are an excellent idea and will be very helpful to your counterparties in understanding how the Adjustment Payment works in combination with inc/dec pricing.I made some corrections to the examples  which I have attached as a redline document so that you can see what I did.  You will also see that I added a few words here and there to clarify things.  The other document is a clean version incorporating all of the proposed changes from the redlined document.SteveSHARI STACK10/24/2000 05:19 PMTo: Robert Badeer/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECT  Steve C Hall/PDX/ECT@ECT Subject: CAISO EXAMPLES Dear Bob- Elizabeth has put together a set of examples to help our counterparties better understand Inc and Dec Pricing.

TransCanada & Westcoast recommend that these matters be deferred and included with our discussions on the commercial proposal and the Partnership Agreement  as we have agreed on a number of other issues.As we discussed on Tuesday s conference call  we believe the first priority for ANNGTC is to finalize the MOU now  & put it "on ice"  to permit all parties to obtain the required governance approvals by Nov. 15 - also the press release would be drafted  circulated & approved and ready to go at that time.Secondly  the commercial proposal to ANS Producers must be initiated in early November to meet a mid-Dec. deadline. This proposal will of necessity have the group addressing the large commercial alternatives in order to establish a viable and attractive project.We recommend a conference call on Monday @ 1:30 PM (Mountain time) to finalize the MOU - we will arrange a dial-in #.. Please provide your comments on the MOU to Murray & I today.Tony"Gadd  Eric" wrote:> Please see the attached red-line with our comments.>> In paragraph 8  I ve proposed new language to address that pre-existing> residual claims must be satisfactorily addressed before a new> partnership agreement would be executed.

Or does FERC not see that as a driver (values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact).  This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage. -----Original Message-----From:  Miller  Mary Kay  Sent: Tuesday  September 25  2001 8:15 AMTo: McCarty  Danny; Hartsoe  Joe; Fossum  Drew; Harris  Steven;  "Gallagher  Boland & Meiburger" <lwin@gbmdc.com>@ENRON ;  Charlie Moore ;  Robin Nuschler ; Porter  Gregory J.; Pavlou  MariaCc:  Rob Kilmer Subject: RE: Settlement OfferI agree it uses an interactive tool  ie  hottap  but I feel what FERC wants is interactive bidding on the posted capacity  so that all have a chance to see others bids and anti up their bid-  EOL doesn t allow that-  MK -----Original Message-----From:  McCarty  Danny  Sent: Tuesday  September 25  2001 8:11 AMTo: Miller  Mary Kay; Hartsoe  Joe; Fossum  Drew; Harris  Steven;  "Gallagher  Boland & Meiburger" <lwin@gbmdc.com>@ENRON ;  Charlie Moore ;  Robin Nuschler ; Porter  Gregory J.; Pavlou  MariaCc:  Rob Kilmer Subject: RE: Settlement OfferBut isn t that exactly what "interactive" means?? -----Original Message-----From:  Miller  Mary Kay  Sent: Monday  September 24  2001 3:10 PMTo: Hartsoe  Joe; Fossum  Drew; Harris  Steven;  "Gallagher  Boland & Meiburger" <lwin@gbmdc.com>@ENRON ;  Charlie Moore ;  Robin Nuschler ; Porter  Gregory J.; Pavlou  MariaCc:  Rob Kilmer ; McCarty  DannySubject: RE: Settlement OfferI don t think we can call EOL an interactive open season  since once clicked it is sold-   -----Original Message-----From:  Hartsoe  Joe  Sent: Monday  September 24  2001 2:17 PMTo: Fossum  Drew; Harris  Steven;  "Gallagher  Boland & Meiburger" <lwin@gbmdc.com>@ENRON ;  Charlie Moore ;  Robin Nuschler ; Porter  Gregory J.; Pavlou  Maria; Miller  Mary KayCc:  Rob Kilmer ; McCarty  DannySubject: RE: Settlement OfferDrew  We need to be careful that we do not provide a marketing affiliate advanced information on capacity availability through EOL.

INVESTMENT IDEASGone digitalCompanies with digital in their names seem to be on a roll.By Dave StermanWhats in a name? Plenty  if youre talking about the word "digital." Screening for fast-growing Net stocks  we found that three of them use that ubiquitous moniker in their title. Recently  we chronicled the bright prospects for Digital Insight (DGIN).This week  were looking at the other digitals  and found a pretty ompelling investment case for each of those as well.

INVESTMENT IDEASCharge!!!Consumers came to the rescue of retailers  and individual investors will come to the rescue of the street.by Charles Payne  founder  chief executive officer and principal analyst  Wall Street StrategiesLast week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliance went from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force  pushing the Taliban back on their heels (or on their toes  as they scatter to caves and tunnels in the southern part of Afghanistan). Wall Street mavens and the media suggested that stocks were pushed higher by the war victories  and while I agree that the prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market  I believe that the week s success had some domestic ingredients as well. In fact  I think the most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were released last Wednesday  once again beating expectations. In the previous week  many observers were surprised to see that consumer sentiment (as monitored by the Michigan survey) came in well above estimates  and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke. After last week  though  I dont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer.http://www.multexinvestor.com/article.asp?docid=4401&nd=1120WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR --------------------------Determine Your Net Worth  Knowing your net worth gives you a picture of your financial condition and helps you plan for the future and set investment goals.

grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us,dan.hyvl@enron.com|grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us|kim.ward@enron.com|kim.ward@enron.com, <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>Dan:First  I ve attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the CityManager to execute the Enfolio agreement.More importantly  I need to inform you that our senior management hasreviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additionalchanges to the agreement for Enron s consideration and to raise questionsabout certain of its terms and conditions.Let me start from page 1  top to bottom  and proceed to the end of theexhibits.1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement whichshould be deleted.2.  The introductory paragraph  line 5  should not contain the words "1st ofJanuary  2001."  It should be left blank  until the parties have signed thecontract.  Otherwise  the City will be in breach as of the date it signs thecontract  because Article 2  section 2.1 requires the City to proffer theto-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.3.  Article 2  Section 2.4  line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction  as defined.Therefore  the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."4.  Article 3  Sections 3.1 and 3.2  first sentence:   Buyer s RequestedQuantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller s failure to Schedule theBuyer s Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller s Deficiency Default.How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller sDeficiency Default if the Buyer s Requested Quantity does not include aMaximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?5.  Article 4  Section 4.1  lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonableattorneys  fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys  fees."  To be internallyconsistent  line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys  fees."6.  Section 4.1  right hand column  lines 3-4.  A statement showing thedetermination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It s unclearwhether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determinationbefore a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled toreceive a copy of the determination and to question it before it isobligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify  or permit theCity to exercise these rights.7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if abankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (underbankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seekdismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section thatbacks up this provision  or change to 60 days.8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The Cityis concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail toSchedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.(ENA s parent?)  but no mention is made of ENA s default in this regard?Please explain.10. Section 4.5  line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"?11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provisionas drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under Californialaw in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.12.  Article 7  Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  Wedon t understand it.13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?14.  Appendix "1"  Claims  line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before"attorneys  fees. 15.  Appendix "1"  GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally acceptedaccounting principles  consistently applied  with respect to Company  andgovernmental generally accepted accounting principles  consistently applied with respect to Customer."16.  Appendix "1"  Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  TheCity has a AAA bond rating  therefore  the  City believes the 2% over primeshould not apply to it.17.  Appendix "1"  Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe theCity s Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also what is ENA s bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that theopinion of counsel will not be required  the reps and warranties are beingdeleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless includedin the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted  because the City has notundertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue anopinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."19.  Operational Flow Orders  line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before"attorneys  fees."20.  Financial Matters  line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has alegal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."21.  Arbitration  Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legalpolicy agree to arbitration  but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enronamenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in myopinion.22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to includea list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade onbehalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section tothis effect?  Then  we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which Ihope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you forresponse.Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after todayuntil Wednesday  March 7.Sincerely Grant Kolling  -----Original Message-----  From: Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com [mailto:Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com]  Sent: Tuesday  February 27  2001 6:16 AM  To: grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us  Cc: Kim.Ward@enron.com  Subject: Re:  Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/SaleAgreement   << File: 2001-002ctr.doc >>  (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)  Grant        I have incorporated the language you provided to me inthe attached  document.

no.address@enron.com, All Enron Worldwide@ENRON,Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible  =there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=e steps we take and recommendations we make  we will be making our faciliti=es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=ty  while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=e (<http://home.enron.com/security>)  by phone (713-345-2804)  or by email =(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=rindle  Senior Director  Business Controls  leads this organization.  Pleas=e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions  =or to report security threats.We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.Access to the Enron CenterOver the next few days  the following access control procedures will be ins=tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =Center  a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver s license  U.S=. or foreign passport  or some form of U.S. federal  state or local identif=ication).=20?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing= in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver s license  U.S. o=r foreign passport  or some form of U.S. federal  state or local identifica=tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=adged contractor at all times.?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=yee or badged contractor  signed into a visitor s log at the lobby receptio=n area by the employee or badged contractor  and escorted to their appointm=ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment  the visitor will be escorted to= the lobby by an employee or badged contractor  the visitor badge collected=  and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =escorting employee or badged contractor.?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=rity (phone 3-6300)  do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=ou or hold doors open  allowing "tail gating" by others.These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times= in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=pment  we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09Travel Advisory UpdateWith the beginning of retaliatory strikes  we have two important recommenda=tions:?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing  corporate security recommend=s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan  Yemen  Pak=istan  Indonesia  Iran  Iraq  Sudan  Somalia  Tajikistan  Turkmenistan  Geo=rgia  and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition  we recommend that =planned travel to Egypt  Israel  Gaza/West Bank  Jordan  Lebanon  Saudi Ara=bia  Syria  and Algeria be very carefully considered.?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States  corporate securit=y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=sult  we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=eir passport  Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest= that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card= as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=t Resident Card  Form I-94 card  Employment Authorization Card  Border Cros=sing Card  or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation  =but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere  it= would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=urrent lawful status.We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=ate Security website and by e-mail  as appropriate.

The analysts and Associates for our group were assessed with the Traders for the first time.The process was that a piece of paper was handed out showing the number of analysts and associates for each different class i.e trading  origination  finance  tech support etc and the forced distribution of rankings that would be followed for each group (I will get a copy of the sheet and fax it to you). We were told to rank all the Analysts (then after the Associates) from top to bottom and these were fitted to the distribution according to the sheet we were given with no deviation from the distribution shown on the sheet. We were told the names of the categories meant nothing and were just groupings ie "Has Issues" did not mean this it just meant the bottom two or three people of the distribution.The electricity desks had already had pre-meetings in which they fitted their own people and they expected every other group to fit their people similiarly.The three A&A people we have here in London were all allocated "Excellent" ratings prior to the meeting but due to forced ranking of people to the defined distribution two of these were moved down to "Strong".I am sorry that I did not send this email on Monday.Regards Shane

That s because investors b=ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=nked  the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=ttractive to buyers  companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=k price failed to rise sufficiently  investors could "put" (that is  sell) =the bonds back to the company--in many cases  after just one year.And that s exactly what s about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=t half of these special hybrids  the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =It simply won t happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =the first chance they can. And because of the put feature  that is possible=. Suddenly companies like Tyco  Comcast  and dozens more are on the hook fo=r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they d never have t=o pay.=20That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all = they re the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt= comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay= bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=ff the debt  creating significant shareholder dilution  especially at curre=nt depressed prices. To make matters worse  this is happening at a time whe=n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=king. "This is a ticking time bomb " warns Margaret Patel  manager of the P=ioneer High Yield Bond fund  a top-performing junk fund.=20The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000  when the stock market started= to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling= stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn t have to ma=ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name "zero"). Instead iss=uers offered an up-front discount--for instance  investors would buy a bond= for $700 and collect $1 000 when it matured.=20Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases  b=y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=m)  zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest  and once their= stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels  the debt would be swep=t away into equity. "If the bonds are converted  it s a home run for everyb=ody " says Jonathan Cohen  vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=eutsche Bank.=20That four-bagger  of course  depends entirely on the stock price rising. If= it doesn t  the bondholders  armed with that handy put feature  can simply= sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders  but not so hot =for the company or its shareholders. But  hey  what are the odds of that ha=ppening? "CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=p " says Cohen. "They don t worry about the bond getting put."=20If all this seems a little complicated  that s because it is. A real-life e=xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time  the company= s stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=ion of company management. "We really didn t want to sell equity at that po=int " says Bob Kelly  Calpine s senior vice president of finance. So the co=mpany instead opted to sell zeros  setting the conversion premium at a heft=y 37%.=20Still  with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile  the bonds weren t exactly a scre=aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=e  eliminating any downside risk.=20Things haven t exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=nce plummeted to $25  and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=e. So it s looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=ere s also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly  Calpine s borrowing ra=te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =cash. "Obviously  nobody plans for their stock to go down " Kelly says. "I =don t think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put."==20Calpine s potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=s straddling junk. "If you are a borderline investment-grade company  a fin=ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =world " notes Anand Iyer  head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=nley. The problem is  there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=atings out there: Jeff Seidel  Credit Suisse First Boston s head of convert=ible-bond research  estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall= into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=ngraded before the put date. Today  with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=centage points above bonds rated investment grade  refinancing can be a pri=cey proposition.=20Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=uy back this January  and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales  the company= was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if= Solectron s credit is downgraded  the zeros would slide into junk status  =a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20Refinancing isn t the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=e amount raised. If the debt is sold back  many will have spent millions fo=r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. "They re getting bad advice= " claims one banker who didn t want to be named. "Look at the fee the bank=er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into."=20As if those potential consequences were not scary enough  shareholders can =also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That s because some 40% a=re bought by hedge funds  which short the company s stock (sell borrowed sh=ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down  the shorts make money =from their position. If it goes up  they profit by converting the bond to s=tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet  at l=east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu  for example  recently lost 10% o=f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.==20Despite all the pitfalls  the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=es  thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=vide. In fact  the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =of financing. Even better  thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code  companies c=an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they re act=ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest= if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications  for instance  would= pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=ce falls below 60% of the issue s conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS = oddly  that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=  for tax purposes  of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=y? Trust us  you don t want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=f more than $200 million  even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=st. Not surprisingly  more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=milar clauses. "It s an incredible deal for them " says Vadim Iosilevich  w=ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. "Not only are they= raising cheap money  they re also doing tax arbitrage."=20So despite the enormous risks to shareholders  companies continue to issue =zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com  seven new issues  tot=aling $3.5 billion  have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. "I think the power o=f the tax advantage is going to keep them around " says CSFB s Seidel. Call= it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =doesn t really matter.

All Rights Reserved. =09Manager s Journal: What Enron Did RightBy Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner11/19/2001The Wall Street JournalA20(Copyright (c) 2001  Dow Jones & Company  Inc.)This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of= age (Jack Welch)  product failure (Ford/Firestone tires)  competition (Luc=ent  AT&T)  technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq)  and dot-bomb bubbles (=CMGI)  managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=ess. The latest example is Enron  whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=roposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20Once considered one of the country s most innovative companies  Enron becam=e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=licts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron s struggles drip with= schadenfreude  hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=rage.We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.= We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=eeded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=s. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=velations emerge  Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=ave enduring value.=20-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric p=ower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=ng by customers  and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=ron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.  and is =spreading to Europe  Latin America  and Asia. The winners have been consume=rs  who have paid lower prices  and investors  who have seen competition fo=rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=nce of California  the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=r industry  is an example of not enough deregulation.=20-- Innovation and the "de-integration" of power contracts. Under the old re=gulated model of delivering gas and electricity  customers were offered a o=ne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers  this system was inflexible a=nd inefficient  like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=xact needs of the customer.=20To do this  Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent= parts  starting with price and volume  location  time  etc.  and offered c=ustomers choices on each one. Again  consumers won. Enron s investors did t=oo  because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=y  Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the "=process of Creative Destruction." But creative destroyers are not necessari=ly likable  pleasant folks  which may be part of Enron s problem today.=20-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logi=c of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company  for i=nstance  owns forests  mills  pulp factories  and paper plants in what amou=nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=tivities better than smaller  specialized firms. Enron argued that integrat=ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=ucracy and the captive nature of "customers" and "suppliers." Enron envisio=ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the= bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy= for the economy.=20-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=  natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=peline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=mber of possible sources  opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=on  and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.= Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network  so that they cou=ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=nt in time to the best use  and choose when and where to convert molecules =to electrons. This policy  picked up by others in the industry  created tre=mendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=ng risks that the firm assumed  and of very strong internal controls. Enron= pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=e best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online  where Enron =made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day  it became essential =to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions  prices and =ability to deliver.=20The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by =the firm  but with fears among trading partners about Enron s ability to fi=nance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=os are too complex to explain in a sound bite  counterparties look to a thi=ck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity  rather than tra=ding risk  that destroyed the firm.=20-- A culture of urgency  innovation and high expectations. Enron s corporat=e culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=ility company is bureaucratic  hierarchical  formal  slow  and full of excu=ses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years= ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious  impatient  lean = fast  innovative  and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses  create markets  an=d transfer within the firm.=20Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion  and an ope=n-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm s organization and culture= was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =rod for the firm s detractors. And yet  it could serve as a model for more =hide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=n of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=siness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in= which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=hment  especially given Dynegy s track record as a second mover following E=nron s lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=itrust review  Dynegy s greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=on s spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope  because prospe=rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=r industries.=20---=20Messrs.

Here was new money  meaning new spending on p=lants  equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=.=20That $10.9 billion AT&T deal  and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=tors  may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =is because corporations  like homeowners  are in the midst of a refinancing= boom.Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap  but b=ecause they often can t get money in other crucial markets. In particular  =they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=OUs used to finance day-to-day operations  where rates traditionally are lo=west -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=ions.=20The result has been a huge jump in bond sales  the majority of which are us=ed to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks  about $13=5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold  up from about $78 billi=on in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =a record  clearing $600 billion  compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20"The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=term commercial paper to long-term debt " says John Lonski  chief economist= at Moody s Investors Service  a credit-rating agency.=20Usually  rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991  corporatio=ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=n  companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=s  a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=990s.=20This time around  the surge in bond deals won t pump in enough new money to= the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though  as in the case of the m=illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =payments  it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=heets and help to fund some of the companies  day-to-day operations.=20Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt  of cours=e  and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation s biggest bor=rowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20But most companies are similar to AT&T  which last week provided the bigges=t refinancing example yet.=20Over the next three months  the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions  corporations pay off ma=turing commercial paper by "rolling over" that debt  or issuing new commerc=ial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much= harder for AT&T after Moody s cut the company s short-term and long-term c=redit ratings. Through the bond deal  AT&T raised money at relatively attra=ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.==20Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =to the commercial-paper market through bonds  loans or revolving credit lin=es. "The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=ts " says Meredith Coffey  senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp.  a d=ebt-market-analysis company.=20For the most extreme cases  the bond markets don t offer refuge. Enron  ham=mered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=rades  drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=ional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors  thus tidi=ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20Most investment-grade companies aren t nearly so bad off  and thus have rea=dy access to bond investors. General Motors  for instance  had little troub=le selling $6 billion in debt last month  while Ford Motor easily sold bond=s totalling $9.4 billion.=20But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=y.=20Take Ford. Standard & Poor s and Moody s downgraded Ford s debt ratings las=t month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3  respectively. With that rating  Fo=rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won t touch it  meaning t=hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=rcial-paper market.=20Boyce Greer  the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments  says he= often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign= of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. "You can t wa=it around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company] " he says.=20Moody s has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =far this year. Thus  the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=o $1.4 trillion at the end of October  down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=f last year.=20---=20Friday s Credit Markets=20Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys.

Since hitting a record low of =2.30% on Nov. 7  the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=%. In the same period  the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=nt to 5.27%.=20At 4 p.m. Friday  the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=s from late Thursday  or $10.94 per $1 000 face value  at 100 25/32. Its yi=eld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20The 30-year Treasury bond s price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317 = up from 5.211% Thursday.=20Why the selloff?

By comparison  the Standard & P=oor s 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.Of course  the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains  the c=ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system  inadequate state ins=titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the "modern" r=ules of corporate governance  according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=anager of the Russia fund.=20"But they are getting more open " Mr. Oubadia said  though Russia s lax fin=ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign= investors. With $49 million in assets  the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet=ween 90% and 95% in Russian stock  with the balance held in cash.=20"While the global economy is slowing  Russia is still in an expansion mode =" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms  consumer spending is u=p 10% and the former Soviet Union s gross domestic product is expected to g=row 3% to 5% next year  more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Eur=ope.=20Two-thirds of the fund s stocks are oil and gas companies  which are still =the most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities  mining  telecommunications com=panies and breweries make up the rest. "There s no escaping oil and gas if =you want to manage a Russia fund " Mr. Oubadia said.=20The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthw=hile  propelling earnings growth for Russia s oil and gas companies. Higher= oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy  which is largely d=ependent on oil and gas. More recently  however  falling oil prices have th=reatened the companies  profit growth.=20But the fund manager  who is based in The Hague  said he doesn t think peop=le should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects.= "You don t invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Rus=sian oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks  low valuati=on " Mr. Oubadia said  adding that most of the Russian oil companies still =trade well below the world-wide average for the sector.=20Yukos Oil is one of the fund s largest investments  making up about 12% of =the fund s holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t=han 5% each of Pilgrim Russia s assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companie=s should be able to handle falling oil prices  partly by cutting production=  he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc=k market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20"Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?" he asked. "The sho=rt answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged t=hat weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and =gas into other Russian sectors  including telecom stocks and consumer produ=cts.=20The Russia fund isn t for the timid. In 1998  when the Russian economy coll=apsed  the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia  lost 83% of =its value. A year later  the fund soared 160%.

All Rights Reserved. =09Blackout in the power sectorA V Rajwade11/19/2001Business Standard10Copyright (c) Business StandardEvery foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these  t=he most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=). This apart  the experience of investors in the "reformed" power sector i=n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago  Orissa was the first state to ado=pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation  transmission =and distribution of power  and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20Clearly  separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=t helps privatisation  the current fashion on the subject having been set i=n Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded  the =experience has not been consistent all over.Take UK s rail sector. While privatising  the government in its wisdom deci=ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine  bewilde=ringly complex system of penalties and incentives  to be monitored by an in=dependent regulator.=20Such separation had no parallel. Besides  Railtrack suffered from poor mana=gement  cost escalation in modernisation of tracks  etc. Several serious ac=cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The "reform" d=id not work  and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=g? Pretty poor  if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=arated the three functions  and privatised distribution and part of generat=ion. AES  a foreign company  was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=ny  and 51 per cent in CESCO  a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=alysed in this paper on August 27  "The policy and regulatory framework was= inadequate and myopic."=20Distribution losses  a euphemism for power theft  were much larger than the= companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO  the transmission company  which in turn= defaulted to the generating company. Indeed  all CESCO s cash inflows are =now escrowed  leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=urposes  the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation  pe=rhaps beyond redemption  and the "reform" is a total mess.=20The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is= less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while  cr=oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=d and the agricultural segments.=20However  as the burden became too large  the commercial sector started movi=ng to captive generation  further worsening SEB finances. An "independent" =regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors  puni=sh power thiefs  face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=ut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative  as  =sadly  they are  the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=antive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =get out!=20Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country  over= and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=ty for gouging power consumers in California  a state in a power crisis (se=e World Money  February 2  2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=on s misfortunes. It became an energy trader  established an electronic tra=ding platform  had broadband ambitions  went into a disastrous diversificat=ion in water supplies which  if I remember correctly  led to Rebecca Mark s= exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=ng  ex-McKinsey  and was notorious for opaque  complex accounts.=20To top it all  last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=ivities. Enron s chief financial officer  who was supposed to be in charge =of these  has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated= with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=on s share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron.=20After its ratings were downgraded  Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx=ious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has= become even more urgent. Reportedly  Tatas and BSES are interested; so are= the lending institutions. Clearly  if a settlement is to be reached  this =is the optimum time.=20But one is not very optimistic. For one  Delhi and Mumbai will be involved = and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=on-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further  if a deal do=es take place  there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=lhi to allow the drift to continue  to "let the law take its own course"  w=hatever the costs! Sadly  as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper  Indian polit=icians respond to developments only out of compulsion  not conviction.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09

Subject:  RE:   Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)   Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)   I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one you   need   at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture   stores   only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if   they   are in stock and usually are.  I ll get some fabric this Friday during   lunch   and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I ll need to order   the   fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.  Also    I ll   find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then   the   other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don t take credit card.  Checks   payable to me and I pay with my company check.   I ll get moving and call you on Friday.   Sound good?   -----Original Message-----   From: Jeffrey.A.Shankman@enron.com [mailto:Jeffrey.A.Shankman@enron.com]   Sent: Tuesday  October 16  2001 2:25 PM   To: CSWART@coair.com   Subject: RE:   Holy cow this is expensive.

enron.announcements@enron.com,ena.employees@enron.com,Car Rental Options for Enron TravelersRental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).National Car Rental  due to its service levels  availability and total value proposition  has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers  needs.Alamo Rent-A-Car  a sister company to National  has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status  due to its service levels  availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National  where available.When you rent a vehicle in the United States  (including Puerto Rico) or Canada  the following insurance provisions are included  regardless of rate selected: 1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo  the coverage is $100 000 per person  $300 000 per occurrence and $50 000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT ***These coverages apply regardless of rate selected  as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron s preferred suppliers  it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National s and Alamo s preferred traveler programs.  National s Emerald Club membership and Alamo s Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.If you have any questions or comments  please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

The facilities are= the transmission assets in the Eastern Division of Rockland s service terr=itory.  This includes approximately 400 MW of load in Bergen County  NJ and= transmission facilities that are already directly interconnected with PJM =(note that other Rockland facilities located in NJ  namely those in norther=n Passaic County and Sussex County (Rockland s Central and Western Division=s respectively) will not be transferred to PJM and will remain under the op=erational control of the NYISO since these facilities are not directly inte=rconnected with PJM nor with Rockland s Eastern Division).  The filing requ=ests approval of the transfer by November 30  2001 which would allow PJM to= take operational control on February 1  2002 (the filing does not address =what  if any  changes to the operation date might be if FERC does not appro=ve this by Nov 30).  Rockland Electric is a subsidiary of Orange & Rockland= Utilities which is a subsidiary of Con Edison.The transfer adds approximately 400 MW of load and 56 000 customers (mostly= residential and commercial) to PJM.  There is no increase in supply  there=fore the total load of PJM is increased by 400 MW without any additional re=sources.  The transmission assets include 138-kV (8.3 miles)  69-kV (35.9 m=iles) and 35-kV (12.4 miles) transmission lines and 11 substations (the fil=ing includes a detailed description of these assets).Let me know if you require any additional information.

EPA did not include the stain tube request for sulfur monitoring.  The methods that are currently listed are wet chemistry methods.  As we discussed  since the permit allows us to use an APPROVED  alternate method  we will need to submit this request at some time.  For the time being  since we want to receive this permit ASAP we should be able to accept the permit as is.2.  It is my understanding that the limits given on CO and NOx are based on ppm @ 15% O2 and not going to the full ISO conversion.  We may want to double check that with the agency.   Arnold -- Do we have guarantees from GE to back up these limits?3.

Generators   affected by this modification should see proper payment of those quantities.   Any   costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers   through   their OATT Schedule 1 residual & BPCG adjustments   For the December settlement adjustment  billing code was modified to ensure   that   appropriate prices corrections resulting from ECA-B were captured in the   billing.   This may impact transmission customers whose transactions were subject to   ECA-B   treatment  resulting in transmission usage charge adjustments.  Any costs   incurred   by the NYISO will be recovered from transmission customers through their OATT   Schedule 1 residual adjustment.   For the December settlement adjustment  a number of grandfathered rights &   TCC   configurations were corrected.  Customers affected by this would see either   their   TCC s converted back to grandfathered rights  or vice versa.  Any excess or   deficiency   in cost recovery will be balanced with the Transmission Owners  based upon   their   respective megawatt-mile coefficients.   There was a code modification to allow for Class 2 PURPA generators to sell   all   over-generation to the real-time market.  This would result in payment to   those   affected suppliers.    Any costs incurred by the NYISO will be recovered from   transmission customers through their OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustment.(See attached file: April_Banking_Instructions.PDF) - April_Banking_Instructions.PDF

All Rights Reserved  Some of the nation s largest electric utilities have secretlyfunneled millions of dollars through two front groups--one headed bywell-known conservative leaders to appeal to Republicans  the otheraffiliated with unions--to stop Congress from deregulating theirindustry.  The campaign  which at times was run out of the offices of theutilities  CEOs  was so secret that some Washington lobbyists forthese same companies were kept in the dark about many of itsactivities  according to documents stamped "confidential" by theeffort s organizers.  The documents offer an inside view of the industry sclandestine efforts to wage its political battle through newly mintedentities with innocuous-sounding names. While the use of such groupshas become a common device in lobbying campaigns  it is rare to obtaina detailed operator s manual for such an effort  complete with candidassessments of individual lawmakers  vulnerabilities and specificbudgets for waging grass-roots campaigns in their districts.  Although the two groups--the conservative Citizens for StatePower and the liberal Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance--haveadvertised heavily against deregulation  until now only those involvedin the effort knew the organizations were the creation of the samenetwork of utilities. This network believed using seeminglyindependent surrogates made their case more believable and shieldedthem from political risk.  A 1998 memo said the utilities ran the groups in anarm s-length way described as "discreet  guarded and highlyconfidential. . . . Fear of congressional reprisals conditioned thisstyle. . . . It would be prudent to avoid rash openness."  Their ongoing "grass roots" lobbying campaign was designed toinfluence members of Congress by whipping up hometown ferment withradio ads directing listeners to call "1-800-BAD-BILL" and telephonebanks wired to connect angry home district residents to congressionaloffices.  The goal of the operation  on which the utilities spent $17million over the last 3 1/2 years  was to bottle up legislation in asingle congressional panel  the House Commerce Committee s energy andpower subcommittee.  The utilities  stealth campaign is one reason energyderegulation legislation has been stalled  although last fall onepartial deregulation bill was reported to the full committee. CommerceChairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) is a staunch industry criticdetermined to move a bill.  The documents describe meetings in Washington steak houses suchas Sam & Harry s where utility lobbyists and consultants shapedstrategies for stopping Bliley. The dozen or so participants in theoperation--who called their effort "The Project"--address each otherin the memos with the kind of blunt talk that isn t often found incivics textbooks.  "The trendline is ominous in that a spirit of accommodation andcompromise is definitely taking hold " said one document in 1998  whenthe utilities feared Bliley was winning over committee colleagues."The number one goal of  The Project  has always been to bottlenecklegislation."  The participants speak of the need to "demonize" the federalagency that regulates utilities and to use debates about nuclear poweras "a highly provocative wedge issue" to destabilize legislativeadversaries.  The memos were given to The Washington Post by deregulationadvocates  and participants in "The Project" confirmed theirauthenticity.  The effort has outraged some congressional advocates of powerderegulation. Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.)--whom the conservativefront group  Citizens for State Power  attacked in home district radioads last year--said it is "bogus" for a group to claim theconservative mantle by protecting big utilities.  "They re wearing a conservative hat  but they ought to bewearing a profit-making hat " said Largent. "The best interest ofconservatives is to create competition."  Citizens for State Power (CSP) is headed by two leading lightsof the conservative movement--anti-tax and Republican activist GroverNorquist  and David Keene  chairman of the American ConservativeUnion--and is run day-to-day by a veteran GOP operative  CraigShirley. It denied for years that it took industry funds  but inrecent years acknowledged taking some such money while offering nodetails.  The Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance (EUSA) also wascreated by utility funds  with the International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers kicking in small sums. It acknowledged some of itsutility backers a few years ago but uses populist language to arguethat federal deregulation would cause layoffs and hurt mom-and-poputility shareholders.  The documents detail how the Washington political consultantswho run "The Project" call into action one or another of these twogroups depending on circumstances. They used the right-leaning CSP tobroadcast ads criticizing Largent in his conservative Tulsa districtand employed the more liberal EUSA to air commercials against Rep.Rick White (R-Wash.)  who a year later lost his seat representing amore moderate Seattle district.  In its effort to stymie federal deregulation  "The Project" attimes argued both sides of an issue before different audiences. Itsparticipants told environmentally minded legislators that variousderegulation bills weren t aggressive enough in reducing utilitypollution but dispatched others to argue to pro-business members thatCongress should not threaten deep emissions cuts.  While energy deregulation is an arcane concept to the public it is an extraordinarily high-stakes struggle for the nation s $300billion-a-year power industry. The battle pits investor-ownedutilities against large manufacturers that want cheap power andindependent power companies  such as Enron Corp.  that want to competewith utilities. For one House Commerce subcommittee markup last year lobbying firms paid temp workers to wait in line outside the hearingroom for two days so the firms would have seats at the markup.  Most investor-owned utilities don t want the federal governmentto deregulate their businesses and introduce competition. Theseutilities say that if need be  they prefer that state legislatures andstate utilities commissions do the job because they are lessheavy-handed than federal officials. So far 26 states have taken thestep.  Deregulation advocates say that the state efforts result in aconfusing regulatory checkerboard and that federal action would lowerenergy prices and encourage investment in clean energy sources.  Many top GOP leaders were eager to deregulate utilities whenthey took over Congress in 1995  seeing it as a test of a bedrockconservative principle: opening the marketplace to competition.  Within months  a group of utilities sprang into action organized by a law firm with a thriving utility practice. The firm which now goes by the name Ryan  Phillips  Utrecht & MacKinnon enlisted several existing clients and  later  numerous other firms.  Soon  the firm had brought in nine utilities that paid from$300 000 to $700 000 a year to fund "The Project" during the yearsthey participated. The main corporate participants  the documentssaid  were Carolina Power & Light  Florida Power & Light  TexasUtilities  Illinois-based Commonwealth Edison  Reliant Energy(formerly called Houston Industries)  Ohio-based First Energy Michigan-based Consumers Energy  Florida-based TECO and Union ElectricCo. in Missouri.  "The Project" was run by law firm partner Jeffrey MacKinnon  aformer top aide to Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.)  chairman of the Housesubcommittee; and Tim Ridley  a former Democratic staff member inCongress who now runs a firm specializing in "grass roots" lobbyingcampaigns.  They and the utilities ran the two front groups and supervisedmore than 50 "mobilizations" in congressional districts  in whichradio aids were aired. Banks of trained telephone operators arrangedfor home district residents to send telegrams or place calls tocongressional offices. The groups also arranged for influentialcitizens in the members  home towns to spread their message--includingthe car dealers who sold members their cars.  While most of the ads were not particularly negative  othersused sarcasm or debatable statistics to attack their targets.  The one broadcast against Largent said he was favoring "Boston bureaucrats and biomass" because the House member had joined with Rep.Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a measure that industry officials saidcould have required utilities to use alternative energy sources. Amemo from late 1998  six months before the campaign  gave a taste ofthe utilities  displeasure with him  describing the firms as "highlyalarmed by Largent s obtuseness" and noting they "could make Largent slife very uncomfortable."  Some congressional Republicans hold Citizensfor State Powerpartially responsible for defeating White  who lost his swing seat toa Democrat  Jay Inslee. A year before the November 1998 election  thegroup aired an ad saying White wanted to raise utility rates by 35percent  and it also circulated a poll and memo among politicalprofessionals showing that White would be beaten easily  in partbecause of his embrace of deregulation.  "For the first time in this debate there were palpablepolitical consequences for appearing to support" deregulation  a June1998 document said. "In the case of Rick White  those consequenceswere direct and career threatening."  White said he doubted the ads played much role in his defeat but he recalls his unease at realizing a GOP group was targeting him.  "I was a loyal member of the Republican cause  and this was acase of shooting a friend in the foot " he said.http://www.washingtonpost.comFolder Name: EmissionsRelevance Score on Scale of 100: 78______________________________________________________________________To review or revise your folder  visit http://www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

beta_041001@airmail.continental.com,tana.jones@enron.com, [IMAGE]?[IMAGE]Tuesday  April 10  2001 ? ?  Dear continental.com customer We re Changing To Serve You BetterThis Thursday evening April 12th 2001  we are launching a new version of our web reservations system  eService Online.  This marks the start of an exciting new beginning as the reservations platform is 100% provided by Continental.We re making this change because our current product  while good  will not provide us with the flexibility in the future to offer the features that will make travel arranging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience for you.Here s What You Need To Know:Your ProfileYour profile information  including your username (tanajones) and password  has been transferred to the new version of eService Online.  To protect your personal information  credit card information has not been transferred.  You will need to update your profile.Your ItinerariesInformation on your reservations created before April 12th will not be saved. If you want to keep a copy for your records  you will need to print them prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.  This change does not affect the status of any previous reservations and tickets  but you can not view them in the new eService Online.  Signing InTo enhance security  you will have to sign in for each transaction session to reserve and purchase flights.  This means you will have to use your password each time.  To have your password e-mailed to you click here.  You are strongly encouraged to sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging process. 24 Hour Hold OptionTo prepare for this Thursday s release we will be turning off the "Hold for 24 hours" option.  The "Hold" option will not be available between April 10 and April 12.Here Are Some of the ChangesMore eTicketingThe new eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets (eTickets).  We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by Northwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airlines (CO2000-2349). Aircraft Seat MapsWe rearranged the seat map pages for easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat selection process and enabled Elite-status available seating. Pricing The pricing system is enhanced to deliver more current fares based on your selection of either "Search By Lowest Fares" or "Search By Schedule."  We also added a gold star to denote "continental.com promotional fares " so you know for certain when you receive a discounted  online-only airfare. Customer Service Our customer service is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now handle all support for online inquiries and reservations services. While we ve made a number of improvements to the overall experience  this new version may not  on the surface  appear to offer significant benefits.  These changes lay the foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the future.  We welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.  Based on feedback from customers  we re already at work adding enhancements.Overall  we re confident that you will appreciate the changes and improvements and look forward to continuing to serve you in the future.Sincerely Continental Airlines Inc.This is a one-time update e-mail.

Perhaps we can all get on a call and talk to determine how we can best coordinate the various matters.  My experience is that often the confirm and annex issues relate and need to be coordinated together if the counterparty has comments.  Per your note I will continue to do the Powerex deal for now.  By copy to Taffy I request that you set up a conference call with Greg  Tana  Mark and myself as soon as our schedules all permit.

I think we might have a misunderstanding on the separation of roles between ECC and ENA.  ECC legal will do the legal work in assisting the Calgary confirm desk in preparing the actual confirms  amendments  terminations  etc.  However  ENA legal will continue to handle all legal matters or inquiries with respect to the negotiation and interpretation of the contracts surrounding the confirms which  I assume  would include the negotiation and interpretation of matters such as the financial GTC forms.  Therefore  I would suspect that the negotiation of the terms of the GTC between ECC and PowerEX  for example  would still be handled by ENA.  Also  as a result  I would suspect that the guarantees would also be coordinated with Clement through ENA.  Perhaps Mark Taylor can clarify on these points.CheersGregMARY COOK11/10/2000 10:40 AMTo: Greg Johnston/CAL/ECT@ECTcc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ProcessesWill you be coordinating with Enron Corp.

Initially  we will only be offering this products as the Seller  meaning the Counterparty will pay the premium and ENA pays the Cash Settlement Amount. The option is  automatically exercised  at any time the capacity of certain named nuclear power plants goes below 25% (which induces the  Knock-in Period ). When this happens the Cash Settlement Amount will be the total of Notional Quantity X (Hourly PJM Floating Price - Strike Price (100 MWh) for each hour during the Knock-in Period  and in no event will be greater than USD 4MM. Knock-in Periods may commence upon the later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the first day a Knock-in Event occurs  and will end upon the earlier of (i) 160 Peak hours after the commencement of the Event  (ii) the conclusion of the Event  or (iiI) the Termination Date; so - you can have multiple Events during the term of the transaction  but there will only be one Cash Settlement Amount pay-out  which will be 30 days after the last date in the term of the transaction.Per Legal  these transactions will be subject to the GTC and should never be subject to any existing Master Agreement.Dale3-9746---------------------- Forwarded by Dale Neuner/HOU/ECT on 07/12/2000 12:31 PM ---------------------------Leslie Hansen07/11/2000 05:50 PMTo: Dale Neuner/HOU/ECT@ECT  Gaurav Babbar/HOU/ECT@ECT  Bill Windle/Corp/Enron@Enron  Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Revised Product Description for EOLAttached please find the revised product description  which reflects my discussions with Dale Neuner.

Anyway  I fly in Thursday and don t leave until Monday.  The interview will be Friday  much like my set-up last time.  So  if you re going to be in town we definitely have to get together.  I think I m really going to look for housing on this trip.  Maybe that will be the goal for Saturday.Talk to you soon Susan

susan.scott@enron.com,jkbowles@hotmail.com,I don t know about the seating.  Do you have NCL tonight?  I can t remember if it s Monday or Tuesday.  Anyway  if we got there early enough  say 7:30 or 8:00  I bet we could find somewhere to sit.  Is that something you d be able to do?
susan.scott@enron.com,julieg@qualcomm.com,Okay...On Friday they have openings at 10:00  10:30 & 11:00 and Saturday there are openings from 2:00 to 5:00.  Either works for me.  The packages I m looking at are about and hour and a half long and I thought to buy you some more time I could just visit all the shops.  Here are the two packages I m looking at...what do you think?  (The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining -- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that s just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower  you ll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it s your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub& Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature s anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub. You ll feel like island Royalty as warm coconut kuki oil is used as the lotion during a 50-minute message that completes the treatment.Benefits: Rough skin disappears as the powerful moisturizing properties of tropical oils sink deep into your skin.Time: 90 minutesTa Ta Susan

susan.scott@enron.com,wilson.kriegel@enron.com,You crack me up...I absolutely loved the trading analogy (at times your insight is frighteningly dead on).  Don t worry about me though.  I will be patient and remain optimistic  despite let downs.  And  in no way  shape or form will I settle and end up with some dush.  You would have been proud of me though  for the first time I was really able to let down a lot of those walls and be a little more vulnerable.  I m thrilled things are going so well with Shannon.  I think your attitude about the whole situation is extremely healthy and mature (it amazing what happens when you care more about the other person than yourself). Talk to you soon Susan* Be sure and let me know next time you re coming to Houston.  We ll go grab a drink and have a good talk.

Houston  Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. s shares havefallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggestenergy trader s dealings with partnerships run by its chieffinancial officer contributed to investment losses.     Enron s stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron s board costthe company at least $35 million by allowing Chief FinancialOfficer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment partnerships that bought Enron assets  a shareholder allegedWednesday in a lawsuit.     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billionin third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall StreetJournal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with thetwo limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders  equityby $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from thepartnerships  the paper reported yesterday.     ``It looks sleazy    said Roger Hamilton  a manager at JohnHancock s Value funds  which own 600 000 shares. ``If you aresomeone who invests in a company s management  it s almost time topunt with Enron.       Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn t return calls or writtenrequests seeking comment. Fastow didn t immediately return atelephone call for comment.     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 millionlast year in management fees and about $4 million in capitalincreases on an investment of about $3 million in one of thepartnerships  the Journal reported today.                        Buying Enron Assets     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies andpartnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.     The foreign business corporations and limited liabilitycompanies have directors  officers or managers whose address islisted as 1400 Smith Street in Houston  Enron s corporate address according to Texas records.     Fastow is listed as a director  officer or managing member ineach one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enronassets  including foreign power plants.     Whitewing Management  which lists Fastow as its managingmember  received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt lastyear.    Under the terms of the debt sale  Whitewing is allowed to usethe proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other``permitted investments.   Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants orcompanies since 1999 and sold four.     Enron s Denne has not responded to written requests aboutFastow s role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of thevalue of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or companyexecutives at Enron s expense.

The energy giant s stock closed down $2.95 or 10.2 percent at $26.05 per share  making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million  its first quarterly loss in over four years. Analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the Wall Street Journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow  who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. "I don t think this thing passes the smell test " said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I think the CFO should be out of there right now. In the interest of the stockholders  that CFO should be gone " he said. Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements  but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities. POOR JUDGMENT? Analysts said that at the very least  the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at Enron  which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high-profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling in August. "For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already  these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors " said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. "It points to poor decision-making on behalf of the board and top management at Enron " he said. Enron  North America s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity  was one of Wall Street s high flyers last year  when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent. The stock s ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company s plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform. This year Enron s shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the Internet soured  Skilling resigned after only six months as CEO  and the company s Dabhol power plant project in India became mired in a payments dispute. Moody s Investors Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron s long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after Enron took $1.01 billion in write-downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non-core businesses  including broadband and water services. Some of Enron s financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings. Analysts said Enron s credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the LJM2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead. "What don t we know that went on at that company? Where s the credibility?" asked one frustrated analyst. "We don t know if it s limited to this " he said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Enron Corp. Cut to `Hold  at A.G. Edwards2001-10-19 16:27 (New York)     Princeton  New Jersey  Oct. 19 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US)was downgraded to ``hold   from ``buy   by analyst Michael C Heim at A.G.Edwards & Sons Inc.BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Broadband Unit Takes A BeatingBy Michael Rieke10/19/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001  Dow Jones & Company  Inc.)A Dow Jones Newswires Column HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Early last year  Enron Corp. s (ENE) hype and skyrocketing share price enticed a number of other energy companies into the telecommunications business.Now investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telecom. The company announced Oct. 16 that its broadband unit lost $80 million before interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of $4 million. In the third quarter of last year  the unit lost $20 million on revenue of $162 million. Enron also recorded a $180 million non-recurring charge for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter of this year. That amount included severance costs for cutting 400-500 jobs  loss on sale of inventory and the reduced value of Enron s content services. At an analysts meeting Oct. 16  Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said the broadband business is "not that robust" right now. Industry revenue is low and there s substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market  "more than even we anticipated " Lay said. The company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for bandwidth trading. Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated potential trading partners. "A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into " he said. "Others thought so  too." Looking back  Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital  Lay said. It spent "too much too soon." An Ominous Comparison He compared Enron s move into telecom with its move into the water business with its Azurix unit. That comparison probably won t be good news to those who still have broadband jobs at Enron. Azurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown - $287 million - than broadband in the third quarter. The water business has been a bigger and longer-lasting headache than broadband. Maybe Enron s surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that Lay told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play in telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recovers. It s trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to $40 million a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year  he said. It could cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business. Meanwhile  the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom business it wants to be in  he said. Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the company needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs. At one time  they had thought that they wanted to use physical network assets as a springboard  Whalley said. Now they "wouldn t want to forever be in the network business." Both executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom. Lay said other companies are asking Enron to do them. Whalley said the company has talked about exchanging fiber and other assets. The one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broadband intermediation. "Intermediation" is a term the company uses in most of its commodity businesses  said an Enron spokeswoman. It s a combination of trading and deal origination - wholesale and enterprise customers. More Bad News Expected Rebecca Followill  a research analyst for Howard  Weil  Labouisse  Friedrichs Inc.  she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quarter. "If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen  you ve got to figure that their assets  values have fallen similarly " Followill told Bandwidth Beat. "I was expecting more like an 80% writedown in broadband." Another analyst  who didn t want to be identified  said he also expects more broadband writedowns from Enron. "To the extent that they can take more writedowns  I think it would make eminently good sense to do it." He predicted "a $200 million haircut" in the first quarter of next year because of a goodwill valuation issue. And that might not be the end of it. Enron had a net of $948 million of broadband property  plant and equipment at the end of last year  he said. They had another $600 million of risk management asset receivables  inventories and working capital items. Followill doesn t see much future in broadband for Enron. "I think the business will shrink to the point where it won t be shown as a key sector in their reporting " she said. Enron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds  she said. Her investor clients don t expect broadband to contribute to Enron s earnings within the next three years. She thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy. The other analyst said Enron is trying to preserve some value in broadband. "It doesn t look like there s any right now  to be honest " he said. "They ll carry the trading operation to some degree." -By Michael Rieke  Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Dynegy Chief: Bandwidth Growth Won t Wait For TradingBy Erwin SebaOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/19/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001  Dow Jones & Company  Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson understands why some think he is mistaken in believing the bandwidth sector has reached its bottom and is recovering. But those critics don t understand his bandwidth business  Watson told Dow Jones Newswires in an exclusive interview. They don t understand how the business world has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks  he said.In announcing third-quarter results for Dynegy Monday  Watson said the bottom in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept. 11 and that the market would begin recovery in the fourth quarter of this year. Businesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operations to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event  be it of natural or human origin. That s what s driving the recovery  he said. Also  businesses will avoid travel  he said  relying instead on video conferencing. Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasn t seen any signs of recovery in telecom. The bandwidth market is suffering  in part  because there are few creditworthy companies to trade with  he said. "They re trying to find trading partners for broadband " Watson said. "That s going to be tough to do." Dynegy isn t concentrating on bandwidth trading because there isn t "a realistic model" for it yet  he said. "I said two years ago it was at least two years away. I still think it s probably at least two years away  before we actually call it a trading commodity." The metro-area infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building will create connections between networks  which are needed in order to trade bandwidth as a commodity  Watson said. It s unfortunate that Enron s model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is the dominant image for the entire market  Watson said. Dynegy s model includes telecom contracts  negotiated directly with customers for long-term supply of bandwidth. Dynegy s bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people. For the past several months  they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegy s customers. The goal has been to build a customer base. "We re looking at being an intermediary  and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today." Since Dynegy lit its 16 000 route-mile network two weeks ago  the trading desk has been trying to fill the company s network instead of buying bandwidth from others. "I m trying to find enterprises that have communication requirements " Watson said. He pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp. (CHX) as a target for those services. "They have offices that never talked to each before " he said. "Now they ve got to talk to each other. I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Texaco is pretty reasonable." ChevronTexaco owns about 26% of Dynegy  said a Dynegy spokesman. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which includes natural gas and gas liquids. The average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications  the corporation s telecommunications unit  is $20 million to $25 million a quarter  Watson said. In the third quarter  it lost $15 million  down from $20 million in the second quarter. Dynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. "If we can get to (income of) $10 million per month - that s what we need really " he said. "If we can get there by the end of next year  I ll be very happy. I think by  03  this market will have righted itself." Watson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy. "Dynegy is an energy company " he said. "Our energy merchant company is doing very well and business is growing like a weed...(Telecommunications) is not our core business by any stretch right now. But I d love to be able to tell you it s going to be. I d love to be able to tell you it is someday." -By Erwin Seba  Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9214; erwin.seba@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  UK: Jobs in base metals down but definitely not out.By Amanda Cooper10/19/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON  Oct 18 (Reuters) - Dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of hedge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed London Metal Exchange members  profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cuts. The decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has prompted a series of high-profile companies to withdraw from the market  casting a pall over next week s yearly LME Week industry gathering in London.Jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks  raising questions about the prospects for those now seeking work. "Good people can always be placed. As long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire " Sarah Gilley of London-based recruitment group Exchange Consulting said. "Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets  people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies." Last week  ScotiaMocatta  a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key ring dealing member  unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the LME floor  prompting around 25 job losses among traders  phone jockeys and clerks. Then blue-blooded banker N.M. Rothschild & Sons closed its London and New York base metals units. It left its core precious metals business intact  but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process. In the same week  the LME s largest floor trader  Enron Metals  said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the Enron Group . SECURITY With three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time  competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security. "What we re finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record  which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they re keen to stay put " Gilley said. "So whereas someone who might be a big money-spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years  they are now staying for three to five years. "They probably feel that they re reasonably safe where they are  they re well recognised and not going to stick their necks out " she said. BONUS FEARS October has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and conferences Also  traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance-linked bonuses  which are usually announced at the end of the year. "Those who are in work at the moment are sticking. Often at this time of year  people are hanging on for their bonuses. But I don t think any of them are anticipating good bonuses. They re probably just happy to have a job " Sian Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said. LME volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi-tech and telecomms stocks. Metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients  and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market. Companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal. "A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re-aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it  " Gilley said. "The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing " she added. As for morale in the industry  individuals  confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed. "Just because I ve lost my job doesn t mean I m going to sell my Porsche " one trader said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  New Power Hldg Sees Meeting 3Q Loss Estimate10/19/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001  Dow Jones & Company  Inc.)PURCHASE  N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- New Power Holding Inc. (NPW) expects to meet its prior third quarter loss estimates; and said it has revised an agreement with Enron Corp. (ENE)  lowering the collateral New Power must post under a master netting agreement. In a press release Friday  New Power said the amendment to the Enron pact and cost-cutting efforts will allow the company to continue to conduct business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing.The company reiterated its earlier expectations of a third quarter loss of $65 million to $70 million  or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Analysts put the company s third quarter loss at $1.16 a share  according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Third quarter revenue will be "slightly lower" than the $60 million to $65 million forecast in August  New Power said. In the year-ago third quarter New Power lost $1.23 a share on revenue of $18.19 million. The amendment to the master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp.  Enron Energy Services Inc. and Enron Power Marketing Inc. affects the master cross-product netting  setoff  and security agreement  and expands through Jan. 4 the types of collateral that New Power is permitted to post to the Enron units. Under the amended pact  the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash  while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of New Power  valued at discounts specified in the amendment  and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. Shares of New Power traded recently on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.67  up 1 cent  or 0.6%  on early composite volume of 7 900 shares. Average daily volume is 223 800 shares. -Bill Platt; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points:There isn t much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well.High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and  (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load  therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme.The market would function better if more information was provided to the market.The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.To see the presentation  detach  save  and view in Powerpoint.  When you do  you will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional information.According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller)  the staff got alot more out of this meeting than Staff s previous meetings with the IOUs and the generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I ve been getting  the Staff is looking into the data we provided.  I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim s version conveys the same message but takes a different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday  Tim talked to Scott and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of scarcity .

(ENE ) never seemed overly concerned =with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices. Earlier thi=s year  the California Attorney General had to get a court order to collect= documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing. And w=hen an analyst challenged former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling in a conference ca=ll to produce Enron s balance sheet  Skilling called him an "ass----." Stil=l  even some Enron executives worried that the company had gone too far wit=h two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge i=nvestments. With Enron s then-chief financial officer acting as general man=ager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their= investments  the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from in=vestors seemed overwhelming. "Internally  everybody said this is not a good= idea " says a source close to the company.But no one could have predicted such a jaw-dropping outcome for the nation =s largest and most innovative energy trader. Since Oct. 16  when Enron reve=aled a $35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnershi=ps and was forced to knock $1.2 billion off its shareholders  equity  the c=ompany s stock has plunged 60%. The Securities & Exchange Commission is inv=estigating Enron s accounting for its partnerships and whether it properly =disclosed them to investors.Suddenly the company  which brought high-tech and complex finance to energy= trading  is essentially trying to avoid a run on the bank. Moody s Investo=rs Service has already downgraded the company s debt. Enron says it is meet=ing with credit agencies to calm their fears  and analysts say Enron is wor=king on a turnaround plan that would likely include accelerating asset sale=s  issuing shares  and obtaining new credit lines. Enron s board has set up= a special committee to look into its controversial partnerships. But analy=sts also worry that Enron s trading partners could pull the plug if they lo=se confidence that it can honor its trades."ON CRACK?" Inside Enron  once-cocky employees are reeling. They were still= puzzling over the abrupt Aug. 14 departure of CEO Skilling when the compan=y announced on Oct. 24 that CFO Andrew S. Fastow  architect of the controve=rsial private LJM investments--which got their name from the first initials= of his wife and children--was removed from his post and on leave. In a ten=se meeting held at a Houston hotel after the latest financial disclosures  =soft-spoken Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay faced 1 600 employees  with ano=ther 5 000 hooked up via the Web. One irate worker asked if he was "on crac=k." Lay  an economist by training  turned over day-to-day management in 199=7. Until Skilling quit  citing personal reasons unrelated to Enron  Lay was= talking about retirement  sources say. Now he is facing his biggest fight =ever. "Ken is looking at a 30-year career of accomplishment going down in f=lames. This is just awful " says one friend.On the surface  at least  Enron s off-balance-sheet maneuvering hardly seem=s the stuff that would crater a company. Amazingly  sources close to Enron =claim that one rationale for Fastow s deals was to save an estimated $30 mi=llion a year in investment-banking fees. Fastow s involvement in the partne=rships  which bought assets from Enron  including stakes in telecom and ene=rgy  was supposed to make the deals simpler for the investment bankers and =thus cheaper. They were also meant  according to sources close to the compa=ny  to hedge Enron s investments in potentially risky assets while allowing= it to maintain some control over them. Enron says Fastow made money for hi=mself on some of the deals  but insiders insist there were less controversi=al ways to enrich him if that were the aim. Fastow did not return calls see=king comment. Lay  who declined to comment for this story  has said that th=e partnerships were properly vetted by Enron s attorneys and internal and e=xternal auditors and were approved by its board. A source familiar with Enr=on agrees: "We had the best lawyers in the world saying  `It looks fine." But whatever Enron s reasons for creating the LJM partnerships  the problem=s were compounded by scanty disclosure. The deals were first revealed in a =1999 proxy  raising concerns from investors and analysts. By this summer  w=hen Enron s stock was falling and its bets in broadband were souring  compl=aints about LJM grew louder. So in June  Fastow pulled out of the partnersh=ips. When the write-offs came  Enron enraged analysts and investors further= by failing to disclose the hit to equity in its third-quarter earnings pre=ss release. Instead  Lay mentioned it in a conference call with analysts. "=We found it disconcerting that the company waited to disclose the additiona=l $1.2 billion charge to equity in a fleeting comment in the middle of its =conference call " says UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone.BAD BETS. Still  Enron s credibility did not vanish overnight. Analysts hav=e been lobbying for years for more information about how and where Enron ma=kes its money in its often byzantine trading business. While the company s =revenues were soaring from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion in 2000 a=nd its stock was returning 500% during the same six-year period  Enron s ag=gressive  even arrogant managers could ignore Wall Street s complaints with= impunity. But after its stock price collapsed this year (chart)  the compa=ny s attitude and operational missteps quickly caught up. And there was ple=nty to worry about. The company s $3 billion power plant in India wasn t pa=ying its bills amid a political controversy; its highly ballyhooed business= for trading high-speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom= industry meltdown; and its calamitous foray into the water business with A=zurix Corp. has already cost Enron at least $574 million in write-offs.These bad bets and the expensive LJM shock have investors worried about wha=t else might be lurking at Enron. Many aren t sticking around to find out. ="I think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the c=redibility of the management team " says Richard A. Giesen  who manages the= Munder Power Plus fund  which dumped its Enron shares about a month ago.It s not clear just how many off-balance-sheet financing vehicles Enron has= used over time. Some were created years ago to finance oil and gas produce=rs. Analysts and sources close to the deals say there s no particular risk =in these to Enron shareholders. Other interconnected entities  such as Whit=ewing  Osprey  Atlantic Water Trust  and Marlin Water Trust  were a way to =get assets no longer central to Enron s strategy off its balance sheet  fre=eing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broa=dband (table).To entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into t=hese deals  Enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren t enough =to cover debt. Such "mandatory equity" deals have been used by at least a h=alf-dozen others in the energy and telecom industries  including El Paso (E=PG)  Williams  and Dominion  says Standard & Poor s director Todd A. Shipma=n. "Nobody s going to find anything that s particularly unique or below boa=rd" in such deals  says one investment banker specializing in the energy bu=siness.Worst case  which Shipman considers unlikely  Enron could be on the hook fo=r about $3 billion in its mandatory-equity deals. That could mean diluting =its shares by more than 25% at today s prices. Analyst John E. Olson at San=ders Morris Harris Inc. (SMHG ) figures a 9% dilution is more likely. Even =if this $3 billion in debt were included on Enron s balance sheet now  the =debt-to-capital ratio would climb to 54% from about 49% at the end of June.= Such a change would pressure Enron s credit rating but not push it below i=nvestment grade  says Shipman.HUGE HIT. Fastow s LJM  a private equity fund  was a different kind of anim=al  according to sources familiar with the arrangements. It bought energy a=nd other assets from Enron  which booked gains and losses on those deals. L=JM was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the vol=atility of some of Enron s investments  including stakes in high-tech and t=elecom businesses and an interest in New Power Co.  which markets power to =consumers. When Enron terminated these deals in September  it took the $1.2= billion hit to equity.But the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with= the company. The first place that might show up is in Enron s highly succe=ssful online platform  which trades everything from gas and electricity to =weather derivatives. To reassure its partners  Enron is scrambling to shore= up its liquidity. It has already tapped $3 billion in credit lines and is =trying to arrange another $1 billion. Shipman says he has seen no signs of =massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms. Still  ri=val traders are wary. "We certainly have taken a closer look at Enron in th=e last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk  but we =re still doing business with the company as usual " says Keith G. Stamm  CE=O of power and gas trader Aquila Inc. (ILA )"SPEEDING TRAIN." Still  with the stock battered and rating agencies consid=ering further downgrades  that could rapidly change. In recent days  the un=certainty about Enron s future has reduced investors  appetite for Enron de=bt. "No one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of surv=ival " says a credit-derivatives salesperson. "It s really difficult to get= in front of a speeding train."Even if Lay can calm his trading partners  he and his management team face =a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on Wall Street. With the= stock now hovering around $14--down from a high of $90 in August  2000--so=me even believe that Enron could be a takeover target for the likes of GE C=apital or Royal Dutch/Shell Group. (RD ) Both declined to comment. Would En=ron sell? One source close to the company says Enron has talked about possi=ble mergers and strategic alliances in the past with Royal Dutch/Shell  amo=ng others. "If they re really worried about liquidity  they might take the =easy way out " he says.If Enron does pull through this crisis  some suspect it will be a humbler  =more risk-averse place. The company that once believed it could expand its =trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities--from advertising= space to steel--will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions. That s= something some investors applaud. "The company should focus on its strengt=hs " says William N. Adams  senior energy analyst at Banc of America Capita=l Management  a major shareholder. But that s a far less exciting place tha=n Enron s energy cowboys ever hoped to roam.=20By Stephanie Anderson Forest and Wendy Zellner in Dallas  with Heather Timm=ons in New YorkNOVEMBER 12  2001=20FINANCE=20Business WeekDerivatives Danger?http://www.businessweek.com/premium/content/01_46/b3757081.htmLately  owners of Enron s (ENE) equity  bonds  and loans have been struggli=ng to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they di=dn t know about before. Now  as a fuller picture of Enron s entanglements w=ith partnerships begins to emerge  investors have something else to worry a=bout: credit default swaps  known as CDSs for short.That s financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans. Their o=wners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they h=ave if their investments go bad. The CDS market has existed only for about =two years  but it s growing fast. Goldman  Sachs & Co. (GS ) and others est=imate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $1 trillion and $1.=5 trillion are covered. Not surprisingly  big banks with hefty balance shee=ts such as J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  )  Merrill Lynch (MER )  and Deutsche Ba=nk (DB ) dominate the market.Enron  however  is a player--and the only significant one that isn t also a= bank. Competitors say that although Enron has issued only between $500 mil=lion and $700 million worth of CDSs so far this year  it had ambitious plan=s to offer them online. "They don t belong in this market " says one trader=. "They don t understand the implications." Enron did not return calls seek=ing comment.Of course  neither Enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans a=nd bonds they re insuring turn bad. Trouble is  this year is potentially a =doozie for losses on corporate debt. Corporate defaults could reach a recor=d of $100 billion  says Standard & Poor s  like BusinessWeek a unit of The =McGraw-Hill Companies. Regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $193 bi=llion by early October.If Enron has insured any of the bad debt  it might have to take charges for= losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting. With all that has =been happening in recent weeks  that s the last thing it needs.=20By Heather Timmons in New YorkNOVEMBER 12  2001=20FINANCE=20By Mike McNameeCommentary: Enron s Clout Won t Sway the SEC=20http://www.businessweek.com/premium/content/01_46/b3757082.htmFor Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt  the SEC s inv=estigation into Enron Corp. (ENE) could hardly have come at a worse time. T=he future of Pitt s ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation co=uld depend on how well he handles this case.Enron s political clout and close ties to President George W. Bush create r=eal risks for the SEC. Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay is a longtime Bush backer  =and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the President s ca=mpaign. A Bush appointee  Pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act. He h=as made it clear he wants to speed up the SEC s enforcement  in part by rew=arding companies that cooperate with probes. But he insists the SEC will st=ill come down hard on true corporate miscreants--and knows that any signs o=f let-up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda.Enter the Enron probe. The fine shadings of securities enforcement--where m=ost cases are settled by negotiated penalties  not court-imposed fines--oft=en make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the SEC is being tough or len=ient. But Pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the Enron case =is handled by the book--getting the same strict scrutiny from the SEC as an=y other  less connected company.For now  top SEC aides say that s happening. The SEC Enforcement Div. in Wa=shington is looking into whether Enron adequately disclosed to shareholders= the risks of its complex deals with Andrew S. Fastow  the company s former= chief financial officer. Agency insiders say Pitt and his fellow commissio=ners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds. But they insist Pitt hasn =t heard from the White House or Enron s other political allies.TOP LOBBYIST. Enron s connections are numerous. Besides Lay s links to Bush=  an Enron director  Wendy Lee Gramm  is the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gra=mm  top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. And Enron spreads its l=obbying budget--$2.13 million in 2000--across both parties. Just this year =it hired four lobbying firms with Democratic roots. Enron says it lobbies h=eavily because it operates in regulated industries. It notes that electric =utilities outspend it 35 to 1.On Oct. 31  a special committee of Enron s board hired William R. McLucas  =former SEC enforcement director  to represent it. McLucas should know that =any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire. Pitt  who joine=d the SEC out of law school in 1968  "remembers how the [Nixon-era] SEC tai=nted itself by turning a blind eye to [fugitive financier] Robert Vesco " s=ays an agency veteran. Pitt has too much riding on the Enron probe to let i=ts connections sway his judgment.=20McNamee covers finance in Washington.

(ENE)  North America s biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity  put pressure on the Ontario government on Wednesday to deregulate the provincial energy market  Canada s biggest  as quickly as possible. Ontario has already pushed back its previous deadline of November 2000 by one year to sort out its deregulation problems and avoid the problems encountered by California in energy deregulation. The delays have frustrated potential corporate players. "We think the right thing for Ontario is to move ahead with this plan  open the markets and get them working " Kenneth Lay  Enron s chairman  said at a breakfast speech at the Toronto Board of Trade. "Let people start building the new power plants and  of course  providing a lot of the types of services we provide elsewhere." Lay warned that the longer the government drags its feet on the issue  the more it places itself at risk of scaring off potential investors. "The delays continue to create uncertainty and uncertainty tends to discourage investment " Lay told reporters. "By discouraging investment  as the market keeps growing  it could be that Ontario is going to have a tough time keeping up with the needs of the economy." Enron plans to build a $250-million generating plant near the southwestern Ontario town of Sarnia  but has delayed the project until Ontario sets a firm date for deregulation. Lay said Enron is "committed to Ontario" even though other companies have said they will move to other jurisdictions if the government does not open up the market by the fall. He said Ontario is far better prepared for deregulation than was California. "I think what California shows is that if you re going to do it  you ve got to do it right. And California did it wrong " he told reporters. "Increasingly politicians are understanding that. You can t deregulate half the market  but not the other half. You can t set up a system that does not allow price signals to be sent to consumers and even after prices go up  you can t just keep shielding consumers from price signals and get no response." Power demand from California s industries and 32 million residents has increased dramatically  but the state has not seen any new generating capacity added in about 10 years. The crisis there has been blamed on California s own 1996 power deregulation law  which required utilities to buy energy on the spot market  where prices have skyrocketed  but maintained caps on the rates they could charge consumers. The problem was then compounded by California s own surging demand  resulting in the rolling blackouts and voluntary power cutbacks of the past months.   2001 Reuters

Their experience in organizing our participation and satisfying each Enron participant in getting access to events is just short of miraculous or maybe just exceeding it.  I was especially pleased that Rick participated so actively as well as our other collegues especially the folks from Omaha who made the Nebraska events such a success. I know that Heidi will appreciate your thanks. To repeat: she and Carolyn deserve some special recognition for a superb job  JoeSusan M Landwehr@EES08/21/2000 09:22 PMTo: heidikp@lonestarstrategies.comcc: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EES@EES  Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@Enron  Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: thanksHeidi--thanks for all of your good work in organizing our participation at both the Republican and Democrat conventions.  While I know that you ve worked with Enron on many events in the past  I recognize the difficulties in dealing with some new "cooks in the kitchen" this time around.  Your professionalism and courtesies to the first timers in this process  including me  is much appreciated.

The three rule changes or designs in other markets you describe look very good and are right on point.  I would like to add two more to your list  namely: 1) Price caps in CaliforniaAttached is a one page memo from my colleague in California  Jeff Dasovich.  Consistent with Jeff s first two points  Steve Kean has told me that in addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state  price caps  and the uncertainty surrounding them  chase new generation away.  The turbine market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other than the operation of the market.  Several generators  including Dynegy and Calpine  have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have ordered.  I have a Nov 10  2000 Megawatt Daily article that quotes Enron and Calpine as saying that price caps in California drove both companies to withdraw proposed plants.  I recognize there is presently no price cap proposal in Alberta but I think we can draw the connection between interference through caps and interference through other forms of administrative intervention that are being considered in Alberta such as: 1) price discrimination on imports  or 2) the latest proposal I heard today from the Power Pool which is capping import offers into the Power Pool at Mid-C prices plus tranmission costs.2) FERC Staff Report on Midwest that apparently states on pages 2-15 that some market participants believe that developers sited new generation in the Midwest because there were no price caps (see attached FERC Report).As we discussed  I will be using this information in upcoming meetings (this Friday is the next one) with the Power Pool and the Alberta Gov t in support of Enron s arguments that policy makers in Alberta must "stay the course" through the higher priced periods  failing which they will make things much worse.In view of the fact it is U.S. Thanksgiving could you please give me a sense of Sabine s timing on this.Regards Rob  "Seabron Adamson" <seabron.adamson@frontier-economics.com> on 11/20/2000 10:39:39 AMTo: <Robert.Hemstock@enron.com>cc: "Sabine Schnittger" <sabine.schnittger@frontier-economics.com>  "Kevin.

Upon return after New Year s  Akshay and I will look at the items in italics below.  Of course  we cannot do analysis out of the context of the model.  Perhaps if you sent Akshay and me the model that is being used to work the answers to Jim s questions (one model or two?)  we can see what we re working with currently.  Please note the following:1. Merit Order Dispatch in the Next Rate Case.Attached below is what my team (Robert Neustaedter) has drafted for the rate case filing on merit order dispatch.  There is a mistake on page 5 regarding the percentage TOP that needs to pass outside merit order dispatch (it s 75% rather than 78%).  Further  we ve asked Ramu to "Indianize" the text before we pass it back to Mr Palumvar.  Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC (or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC)  and this filing should serve as a foundation for this rate case (and others).   2. Merit Order Dispatch "Cap".  The May 5  2000  order treats two concepts as one: the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit order dispatch  which is  a day-to-day operational tool that determines actual purchases.  The rate case order of May 5  2000  as written  did not "cap" the quantities.  What the rate case stated (and I am not quoting) was that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long as the average realisation exceeded the cost.  I would also argue that the India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further dispatch quantities.  The "catch" is in two places:  first  whether dispatch of DPC power meets the test (Shubh told me recently it did -- does this continue to hold true  Mohan?)  and second  the recovery of the power purchase costs due to the variance (the difference between what is authorized in the order and what is actually dispatched.)3. Recovery of Variance. According to Mr Podder  the Electricity Supply Act  1948  does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the next.  (Typically  the variance is just included in the next rate case.  This practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs for a period of time  which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to understate demand.  We have approached the MSEB  rate case  however  with a different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more funds for MSEB to pay its bills.)  As provided in the Act  the variance must either be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB.  This is a major financial problem for the SEBs and should be rectified by GOI.  Mr. Podder is writing down the accounting legal basis in Act  and I will forward that memo to you.4. MSEB Representation regarding dispatch.MSEB clearly discusses its failure to dispatch more than 3044 MU with us in the rate case process.  Mr. Palumvar and Mr. Bakshi state that failure to dispatch additional quantities is simply a matter of budget.  The cost of 3044 MU is incuded in the rates  and the cost of additional volumes isn t.  Since there is no way for MSEB to collect the cost for additional volumes other than from the State  it is logically not dispatching additional volumes.5. MERC Jurisdiction. Thus  I have a query: let s assume that the MERC does not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order dispatch or to determine a blend of the two.  I m not sure how that will help MSEB to recover the full costs of its power purchases.6. Logical Area of Focus. In my opinion  once Sandeep Katwala and team confirms our interpretation of the Act  the most beneficial course of action would be to work with the regulators/Government/anyone else to repair the cost recovery mechanism of the Act.  This helps DPC  this helps MSEB and will  in the end  help the country.Might be worth considering. ---------------------- Forwarded by Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 12/27/2000 08:23 AM ---------------------------Sandeep Kohli12/21/2000 01:41 AMTo: Mohan Gurunath/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: Dabhol question  Mohan I have gone through your note  and agree with the concept.  You do have to compare end-user tariff with costs till end-user  which will include T&D losses.You have assumed 30% loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement (since this is the worst case scenario) Your assumptions on Rs. devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be for a pessimistic scenarioYou have assumed that MSEB s average realization per unit in $ terms actually goes down due to Rs. devaluationThere are some areas where Jane can shed more light:MSEB can increase its average realization  simply by limiting supply to agri. customers  and by not giving any new unmetered connectionsThe latter is something that has been decreed by MERC (Jane please correct me if I am wrong)  while the former was the most likely cause for Bhave s exitJane - Can you (with Akshaya s help) take a crack at what the agricultural load and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years 2002 through 2004 ?  Similarly  what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories?Also  if Dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at Mumbai (following Mohan s conclusion of 75% PLF on  2400 MW)  and the plants close to Chandrapur were to despatch less  what would be the overall T&D loss picture ?  The question to answer here is what portion of the 30% is theft  and what is actual T&D loss.  My understanding is that betwen 16-18% is actual T&D loss due to the poor state of the network.  Further  we will have to ask the question whether the actual T&D loss is more due to distribution or due to transmission.  My gut feel is that it is due to distribution.The next logical question to tackle then would be what you see as the improvement in distibution between now and 2004.  Jane - Can you take a crack at that ?Mohan - My gut feel is that there will not be a 75% despatch on all three blocks.  I can envisage that type of despatch in Block B  but that will be the optimistic rather than the pessimistic scenario.  I do not see C being used more than 6-8 hours daily  and that too only in the peak season.  I had started the team working on a stack and peak and off-peak load curves.  We need to do more on that.Bottom line is that we need much more detailed information on the T&D sector  on the pace of reform  and most importantly on merit order deptaching of the plants (building the stack of plants).  This was Jim s concern too when we met this morning  and we will need to develop a plan to move that forward further.Regards Sandeep.Mohan Gurunath12/20/2000 09:35 PMTo: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Sandeep Kohli/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: Dabhol question  Attached is an analysis of Jim s question for your review/comments.RegardsMohanTo: Mohan Gurunath/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Sandeep Kohli/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Jane Wilson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc:  Subject: Dabhol questionCan you 3 Amigos look into this and come back to me with a joint response for Jim?

However  here is one more.I was thinking about how to determine our worst case.  While considering this  I came up with a question I couldn t answer:  What is our breakeven power price at the overall PLF we think would be achieved if MSEB used marginal economic cost dispatch.  If we determined that this price was at or above the realised tariff of MSEB  then we know ultimatley we will survive  the only question is how long it takes us to get our equity back.  If it is below  then the situation may be dire indeed.Jim

During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a efficient market.   In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with the premise that there is a "problem" that requires "emergency" amendments to the Pool rules.  Our position has been that Alberta is short supply  and significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage new generation development. Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address and what the process will be.   We discussed the process and it appears he will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules.  Dale said he would try to pull together a "terms of reference" document that would define the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow.After my call with Dale McMaster  Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas:1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist us with preparing a letter that states that Enron s participation does not represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing in Alberta and that Enron s participation on the committee is on a without prejudice basis;2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market  ii) would be contrary to the development of an efficient  fair and openly competitive market for electricity  iii) would compromise the independence of the Power Pool  and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the real time price of electricity in Alberta.  Once Blakes receives a copy of the Frontier Economics memo  they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the provisions of the EUA;3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal to the AEUB  and/or legal action in the Court of Queen s Bench) in the event the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the end of this two week period.   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any possible legal remedies.

I made the changes based on what we have done in ARCOS. They are not the same because in ARCOS GE has the full testing program within their Commisssioning Period since they have the power island which is 1200 MW with the Purchaser having 24 MW for aux loads.I do not think that my new subparagraph (K) works.  I have left it there to see if anyone else can tweak it and make it work.  I am trying to get GE on the hook for acceleration costs that we incur and still beat the Time for Completion.  We did not do that in Arcos since GE s time in theory is the same as the contractors.Probably merits an internal discussion before sharing with GE.

A couple of outstanding questions- 1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility  independence  and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However  I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?

If this is true we should evaluate the margin vs the credit and legal risks.Lavo -----Original Message-----From:  Calger  Christopher  Sent: Friday  February 09  2001 9:38 AMTo: Lavorato  JohnSubject: RE: CDWR UpdateCDWR is not positioning itself to buy new power assets.  Whether or not they buy the output from Pastoria  the plan would be for us to sell the project this year.  Calpine is the high bid and they are open to the project having a California toll on it.   We believe that the proposed pricing of the power sale to CDWR would be attractive to other power plant buyers as well as Calpine. Our current obstacle relates to water - Azurix breached their water deal with the project so we are "fixing" it by dealing directly with a backup water supplier.

They are immediately interested in a 5 year power sale and then want to discuss Pastoria.  I updated a price for Freeman for 200MW Peak SP-15 5 Year ($124/MWh).  I also spoke with their lawyers a couple of times to start trading comments.  I volunteered to send a team to LA today or tomorrow  but so far they prefer to discuss by phone.   Their lawyers acknowledge that the primary issue for suppliers is credit.  They are working on an agreement with CPUC that would ensure that CDWR would have an adequate revenue stream to support the contracts.  Their intent is to make the supply contracts have priority over the bonds.  Until that happens  we maintain that we require a cash prepayment or letter of credit to support any deal.  I expect to hear from them again later today.  I will keep you posted.Regards Chris

Privately held Enform said Palo Alto  Calif.-based Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is letting the company employ its integrator technology called iForce eIntegrators  for use in creating Web applications and building back-end systems that connect to the site. Sun will help Enform build its service offerings and create custom consulting services  which will be jointly marketed.  How much more business this will bring to Enform is not clear  and company officials today were not available to discuss the deal. Enform  which is run by John McNevin  a former partner at Ernst & Young  has grown quickly in its three-year existence. The Houston company helps businesses reinvent themselves by upgrading their systems or finding new technologies they need to remain competitive.

The company has about 200 employees  with branch offices in Dallas and Austin  and expects to post sales of about $21 million this year. Enform recently told LocalBusiness.com that it expected to log about $100 million in sales next year  if the economy holds. Its client list includes Microsoft Corp.

I also know that those that we can not trust are aware that we are not afraid to press for answers and action!  Its interesting in that there seems to be two groups of individuals developing.  Those that are personally self centered and ask what s in it for me and a larger group of individuals who want to end the selfishness and work for the good of the total company.  Besides they all know as you do that I can be a real asshole if I don t get my way.

Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response: 1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow s contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity. 2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron s intent as far as payment or litigation? 3)  What other Enron employee s have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?Your clarification of the above questions would be appreciated!

U.S. companies cutfewer jobs last month than anticipated while activity atfactories slumped further. The manufacturing figures areroughly in line with other recent factory readings  but thejobs release is a head-scratcher -- and that s why majorindexes bounced up and down in a tight range much ofFriday.But sometime after lunch  investors began to bid up keystocks and the major indexes followed.The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 78 points at10 990. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 39 to close outthe week at 2149. The S&P 500 ended up 5 at 1261.Optimism has resurfaced that perhaps the worst is over fortechnology stocks. Intel  Microsoft and Oracle advanced.Novellus and Flextronics affirmed that their earnings wouldfulfill current expectations  and shares of both companiesjumped more than 5 percent. (Sometimes "poor visibility"turns out okay. Just keep your guard up -- second-quarterconfessionals are starting to roll in.)Perhaps short-term money should head for the beach andleave stock picking to the folks looking ahead six to 12months  or longer. Surely there are bargains ready to pop but finding them has never been tougher.Dean PattersonStocks Editor  CNBC.comMAJOR INDEXES AND VOLUMESNext button  choose semicolon as your Delimiter  and thenFinish.* Dow Jones Industrials: 10 990.41  up 78.47 or 0.72%* Dow Jones Transports: 2 887.05  down 58.85 or 2.00%* Dow Jones Utilities: 389.52  down 3.70 or 0.94%* S&P 500: 1 260.67  up 4.85 or 0.39%* NASDAQ Composite Index: 2 149.44  up 38.95 or 1.85%* Russell 2000: 501.72  up 5.22 or 1.05%* FTSE: 5 809.60  down 3.30 or 0.06%* NIKKEI: 13 261.84  down 0.30 or 0.00%* Ten-Year Treasury Note Yield: 5.40%* NYSE volume (preliminary): 1 billion shares* Nasdaq volume (preliminary): 1.5 billion shares* To see our complete U.S. index list http://www.cnbc.com/news/markets/world.html?ReferrerID=MMSCOUTING REPORT: MONDAYNext week s calendar is devoid of economic reports thatwill matter five minutes after they hit the tape.Amazon.com talks to analysts on Tuesday -- keep an eye onthat.

e..haedicke@enron.com,michelle.cash@enron.com,I agree with your proposal.  Please communicate with Mark Holsworth.  Mark Michelle Cash 04/11/2001 11:33 PM     To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT   cc:    Subject: Re: Mark As a practical matter  I believe that it will be difficult to maintain an updated inventory of confidential information on an ongoing basis.  That conceivably could be someone s full-time job  given the vast amount of confidential and proprietary projects at issue just within EWS.  I do agree that we need to put some protocols in place with regard to how Enron handles different levels of confidential information (including trade secrets).  Rather than have an ongoing commission guided by outside counsel  I would suggest that Pete  Scott Tholan  the IT security team  internal corporate security  as well as legal subject matter experts get together to put forth guidelines on how information should be retained and protected.  Those guidelines would describe the type of information at issue and the corresponding security measures to put in place to protect that material.  For example  trading positions and curves would have one standard for access and disclosure  while personnel information would have a different one.  The benefit to this approach is that we can set the guidelines and manage on a periodic basis to make sure that they are followed  rather than create updated inventories.  It also presumably would save on outside counsel fees.  I would not view this type of approach as requiring much  if any  assistance from outside counsel.Let me know your thoughts.Michelle---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Michelle CashEnron North America Corp.1400 Smith Street  EB 3823Houston  Texas  77002(713) 853-6401michelle.cash@enron.comThis message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.

Mark----- Forwarded by Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT on 04/11/2001 02:58 PM ----- Mark Holsworth/ENRON@enronXgate 04/10/2001 11:21 AM      To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT  Drew Fossum/ENRON@enronXgate  Kristina Mordaunt/Enron Communications@Enron Communications  Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES   cc:    Subject:   Pete Van De Gohm of EES has again raised the topic of inventorying our trade secret protection which has been discussed from time to time.  I have visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing your major groups.  It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K committee did.  We would have Fulbright & Jaworski give our people general instructions  our business people would canvass our companies to determine what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting our proprietary information appropriately  we could address that issue.  Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to a specific operating group.   I believe we need this inventory.  If we try to enforce our non-competition agreements and we can t prove that we kept such information on a need to know basis and properly secured  we could lose the law suit.    Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in agreement with the proposed plan.  Please respond as soon as possible if you agree so we can get the project off the ground.

stanley.horton@enron.com,a..hughes@enron.com,I think we should talk with them if the have the cash.  However  I get very= nervous when anyone would commit $100 to $200 million with limited due dil=igence.  Also  I would not want to announce anything until the deal closes.=  Preannouncing a deal of this size isn t goi8ng to stabilize anything.  $1= to $2 BILLION might get a different answer.  As to your involvement  you m=ade the right call. -----Original Message-----From: =09Hughes  James A. =20Sent:=09Tuesday  November 27  2001 8:23 AMTo:=09Horton  Stanley; Donahue  JeffSubject:=09Potential DealStan/Jeff:I have been contacted by a number of close friends/business contacts that w=ant to put together a deal to buy a number of our smaller assets  primarily= the power assets.  The strategy they have in mind is simple.  They want to= offer us a lightning quick sale of a package of small non-core assets that= together would be a material deal that could be announced and help stabili=se our situation.  They would then be able to manage in a more orderly mann=er either the sale or continued operation of the assets and hopefully reali=se a premium over what they pay us.  They have power and energy industry ex=perience.  In the interest of full disclosure  they asked me to participate= in the deal  but I have said that probably makes a negotiated deal unlikel=y given the related party concerns.  I indicated if they want to do a deal = they will have to leave me out of it. They have indicated a willingness to= conduct due diligence over ten days  sign an agreement and announce the de=al and then close by end of the year  but only if we can begin immediately.=  They are assuming we would put a priority on both announcing and funding =a deal quickly.  They are willing to structure around issues to meet this o=bjective.I intend to meet with these guys and make my own judgement as to the legiti=macy of the proposal.  I think they are considering a transaction of betwee=n 100 - 200 million.  It would probably involve a half dozen or so assets. = Not a huge deal  but it would efficiently get rid of some cats and dogs.  =It probably qualifies as a "fire sale"  but might make sense anyway.Your thoughts?Jim

This is a great last minute chanc=e to save a lot of  money (save about $120 a case!). And we are still offer=ing a 10% discount off the sale price on a full case when you  use 3 day ai=r to ship.   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]               [IMAGE]  Beaux Freres winemake=r Mike Etzel Trying the 2002 vintage   Beaux Freres  Pinot Noir 2000 $56.99= SALE  will be  $68.99 after Friday This is their standard bearer- their  f=lagship wine that gets such high ratings each year. The 99 was one of two O=regon wines on the "2001 Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines  of the World" list. =This wine should do at least as well.   An excellent vintage from Ribbon Ri=dge  the 2000 has a deep  saturated ruby/purple color. Ripe black cherry  c=ola  and blackberry fruit dominate the bouquet. In the background a hint of= spicy  oak can be discerned. Still youthful  this medium to full-bodied wi=ne has a layered palate  moderate tannin and a sweet  long  finish. It is a=lways difficult to compare one vintage to another  but 2000 may represent a= hypothetical blend of 1998 and 1999. It  is not as powerful  muscular or t=annic as the 1998 nor as forward  charming and accessible as the 1999. It i=s a big wine and  certainly ranks with our finest vintages to date: 1993  1=994  1998  and 1999.   JEAN SAYS; THIS IS GREAT WINE! 4-12 YEAR CELLARING  =A WINE TO STRETCH THE  POCKETBOOK FOR!  Beaux Freres  Belle Soeurs Shea Vin=eyard 2000 $44.99  SALE  will be $56.99 after Friday    Their finest Shea V=ineyard offering to date. It displays a healthy  saturated dark ruby color =with purple nuances. Shea tends to be a seductive  open-knit effort  even i=n a more tannic year such as  2000. Copious sweet  creamy  black cherry and= berry fruit intermixed with toasty wood emerge from the wine s aromas. Med=ium to  full-bodied and fleshy  with more structure than previous vintages = the 2000 offers the vineyard s hallmark black fruit and a  silky  lusty  h=edonistic personality. It should drink well young   and evolve nicely for a= decade. Vineyard Manager: Dick  Shea.  Beaux Freres  Belle Soeurs Temperan=ce Hill Vineyard  2000 $44.99 SALE will be $56.99 after Friday   Their firs=t offering from Temperance Hill Vineyard  located in the Eola  Hills of the= Willamette Valley. This dynamic wine possesses a saturated dark ruby color= and a sweet nose of cranberry  strawberry  and black cherry fruit. An impr=essive attack is followed by moderate yet ripe tannin. The wine reveals sed=uctive aromatics  fine  density  medium to full body  and plenty of materia=l  but it will require a year or two of cellaring in order to shed its tann=in.  At its best between 2004-2012. Vineyard Manager: Dai Crisp       Just =in and exciting:  Chateau Ste Michelle Eroica 2001!!!  $25.99 just in!

These include ISDA Master Agreements and brokerage (futures) agreements executed in the name of Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.  We need to incorporate these agreements into Lotus Notes and David Minns needs to have access to our database.  Do you want to speak with Alan or should I?  Also  on a related issue  do we need to keep copies of the ECTRIC Master Agreements in Houston?  Would this be necessary in an emergency situation?  Thanks.  Sara

In addition  if the shares trade over the exchange  I am not sure exactly how we will execute a private sale between those 2 companies.  It seems to me that you may want to have the ultimate owner actually make the purchase and then try to structure your cashflows to accomplish your tax goals  rather than to accomplish those goals by moving around the shares.

robert.bruce@enron.com,sara.shackleton@enron.com|carol.clair@enron.com|mark.e.taylor@enron.com,(1)  Market quotation v. Loss -- At one of the workshops at the ISDA conference in March  I picked up some tips from the Goldman Sachs speaker that I have found useful in arguing on behalf of Loss.  I think we should also put before the group a uniform acceptable carve-out for MQ (in terms of duration and commodity)  with the understanding that we should only offer the carve-out after every effort has been made for Loss applied uniformly.(2)  Legal opinions from international counterparties -- I think we could use clearer guidelines on when to require these.  My own thought is that we should try to get comfortable with going without to the extent possible with respect to Western European counterparties (absent any red flags particular to a counterparty).

As we may have noticed though  a lot more companies are doing so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in using "exchange" in your corporate name  however  putting "exchange" in a company s name may put you on the CFTC s radar and get you more scrutiny.He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong  so if we ever anticipate doing business there  it might not be a good idea.

petej@andrews-kurth.com,mark.elliott@enron.com|sara.shackleton@enron.com|sara.shackleton@enron.com,Mark Pursuant to our earlier conversation  I have the following questions which relate to the Financial Services Authority s Conduct of Business rules:1. The Agreement provides that the Broker may "from time to time effect transactions with or for ENA in Non-Readily Realisable Investments (as defined in the Rules)"I presume this is acceptable  but please confirm.2. The Agreement provides that  "the protections in the Rules on giving suitable advice will not apply"Again I presume this is acceptable since we will probably not be using their advice  but please confirm.3. The Agreement provides that "Any monies arising in the normal course of business  will be held by our agent in accordance with the Financial Services Regulations 1991 and the relevant rules of FSA."Please confirm that this is acceptable.4. The Agreement provides that it shall be governed by English law and that ENA submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.  I know that ENA has specific policies in the US relating to governing law and submission to jurisdiction.  Please confirm with me that the above-referenced provision is acceptable.Thanks Jason

sejalhpatel@hotmail.com,rod.hayslett@enron.com,Dear Mr. Hayslett: It was a great pleasure meeting with you Monday night.  I really enjoyed hearing about Enron.  It really gave me a better understanding of Enron and the businesses Enron is involved in.  Also  I now know the type of candidates that you are seeking and the opportunities that exist there for me.  As a result my interest in working for Enron were strengthened.      opportunity is exactly what I have been looking for  something challenging and fast-paced.  I am confident that my background and experience will allow me to be a great asset to Enron in various capacities.  I am attaching a copy of my resume and I sincerely hope that I have the opportunity to prove this to you.   I hope I am the type of person you are looking for as well.  I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thanks  Sejal Patel

The 30+ page report is available on the home page of the CBO s web site at www.cbo.gov.  I have quickly read through the summary and it is largely favorable.  For example  the summary says:"Much of the blame for California s electricity crisis attaches to the state s restructuring plan -- but not to its objective  electricity deregulation. (...)  But deregulation itself did not fail; rather  it was never achieved.""The restructuring plan did not remove sufficient barriers on both the supply and demand sides of the market to allow competition to work -- in part because it was not designed to.""Even without restructuring  California s electric utilities would have faced a difficult challenge in meeting the demand for power and holding down prices in 2000.""Consequently  wholesale electricity prices were higher than they probably would have been in either a traditionally regulated market or a more fully deregulated market.""Long-term solutions to California s electricity problems will most likely require three changes: removing barriers to the addition of generating capacity  eliminating bottlenecks in the electricity transmission system  and removing regulatory restrictions on the sale of power throughout the broad western market."On the negative side  the report summary does state that "some generators may also have withheld supplies at certain times to boost prices even more" and "the plan s auction system for the spot market appears to have created strong incentives for suppliers to bid strategically in a way that raised wholesale prices."

Jeff should only be there to make introductions.2. Meet & Confer (10/29) Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  3. Reformed Stipulation I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich s idea to get together with SCE on Thursday  maybe let this ride.4. Meeting My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.

pressoffice@mcgreevey2001.org,rshapiro@enron.com,McGREEVEY HOLDS ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION ON IMPORTANCE OF LITERACY &  "READING COACH" INITIATIVE AT LIVINGSTON SCHOOLLIVINGSTON  NJ - Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim McGreevey today highlighted the importance of literacy and the need for his "reading coach" initiative during a roundtable discussion with teachers and reading coaches at Harrison Elementary School in Livingston.McGreevey visited the school because its reading coaching program has been successful and serves as a model for the program he wants to expand in the state to help make sure that every public school student can read at grade level or better by the end of third grade."There is no question that reading is the key to learning and opportunity for our children " McGreevey said. "This is the kind of program that I want to see in our elementary schools.  As governor  I will make it our top priority making sure every third grader can read at or above grade level  and we will focus our energy and our resources at addressing this goal."A key component of McGreevey s education platform  this initiative would provide a reading coach to every school that needs one to work with children to ensure that each of their individual reading skills are being developed  and they will also coach teachers on more effective ways to teach reading.Research has shown that students are far more likely to fall behind in every subject if they have not acquired the necessary reading skills by the end of the third grade.  But in New Jersey  more than 800 elementary schools out of 1321 statewide have more than 30% of fourth graders who can t read at their grade level.  McGreevey wants to provide those 800 schools reading coaches to improve students  reading skills. "We cannot wait until the fourth grade to begin addressing the needs of children having difficulty with reading - by then it may be too late " McGreevey added.McGreevey has made education the No. 1 priority in his campaign for Governor.  He earlier unveiled his education agenda to improve our public schools with a new set of the three "R s" - Reading  Reform  and Responsibility.  In addition to his reading coach plan  McGreevey s plan focuses on improving the quality of teaching  expediting the process of removing teachers who aren t performing more quickly  and holding teachers  administrators  government  students and parents more accountable.McGreevey s education plan presents a sharp contrast between himself and his opponent  Republican Bret Schundler.  Schundler would use taxpayer money for private school vouchers that would take nearly $600 million out of public schools - helping about 80 000 students at most - or six percent of the student population.*****Paid for by McGreevey for Governor 2001  Inc"Fights for New Jersey.

There is less than .0001% chance that the Govwould veto this bill!  So were on!!!  We are going to be in Senator Derfler s office first thing tomorrow  (Monday)to see when HB 3696 will be scheduled.  We will make sure that the -13amendments are not adopted and the -15 are adopted.  At this point were are85% sure the -13 s won t be  we plan on shoring that up in the morning!Pollution Control Tax Credits SB 764 is up today at 4:00 PM for a hearing  sofar it looks like we will be fine if the Gov. s office agrees to the latestdeal.  Our biggest issue are the Trojan credits and Kristina McNitt coversthis issue for PGE  she is less known as a PGE lobbyist than I am.-So far wehave been successful in keeping the T-word (Trojan) out of the building thissession. We are working closely with the other parties on PCTC vote counts andindividual lobbying but when the deal is being cut if PGE shows up there isthe possibility that the T word could tube a deal or attract some anti Tfollowers-so we have been very careful and low key on this issue.  We are veryoptimistic about getting what we need even if it is at the eleventh hour!!

Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding  however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).Including Enron on the Creditors  Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors  committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor  2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution  and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just "passthroughs" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).

In November 1998 the PSC concluded BellSouth had met the local exchange market-opening mandates in section 271 of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996.  BellSouth yesterday submitted third-party test results of its Georgia operation support system and proposed performance-measurement and penalty plans.  BellSouth asked the PSC to reaffirm that it has met the Act s market-opening requirements.Compliance with section 271 s 14-point "competitive checklist" is a prerequisite for FCC authorization to provide in-region interLATA service.  The FCC must consult with the U.S. Department of Justice and relevant state regulators before ruling on the applications.  (Docket no. 97-AD-321)______________________________________________________FLORIDA -- Broward County repeals  open-access  requirementBroward County  Fla. s County Commission yesterday voted to repeal an ordinance that had required cable TV franchisees to offer unaffiliated Internet service providers "open access" to their cable modem platforms.  The vote puts the final nail in the coffin for one of the earliest open-access initiatives.In 1999  Broward became the second county in the U.S. to adopt an open-access requirement following the lead of authorities in the Portland  Ore.  area.  (7/14/99)  A federal district judge in Miami  however  ruled last year that Broward s ordinance violated cable TV companies  rights to free speech and expression.  In "Comcast Cablevision of Broward County et al. v. Broward County" (case no. 99-6934-Civ)  Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks was the first to rely on the First Amendment in nixing a locality s open-access ordinance.While the county s appeal of that ruling was pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (Atlanta)  the cable TV companies filed a claim seeking attorneys  fees from the county  said Terry Bienstock  a Miami attorney with The Bienstock Law Firm  P.A.  who represented the cable TV companies.Both sides agreed to a settlement under which the parties would drop their legal claims if the board voted to repeal the ordinance  Anitra Lanczi  Broward s assistant county attorney  told TR.  That agreement prompted yesterday s vote  she said.______________________________________________________CALIFORNIA -- Pacific Bell to report on CLEC operational issuesPublic Utilities Commissioner Geoffrey Brown has directed Pacific Bell to file by May 29 an updated list of operational problems recently raised by competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs).  On April 4-5 Mr. Brown convened a hearing to examine more than 50 systematic operational problems the CLECs had identified concerning ordering  provisioning  post-provisioning  and multifaceted issues.During the hearings and the following six days  Pacific Bell and the CLECs met to resolve as many issues as possible.  During an April 12 hearing  Pacific Bell presented a status report  which set task-completion dates for certain outstanding issues.  Mr. Brown said he wanted Pacific Bell to update the summary regularly to allow the staff to monitor the progress.  The May 29 summary will identify which issues have been resolved and highlight issues affecting more than one CLEC.  Comments on the summary will be due June 11.  The staff will compile a final summary of the issues by June 21.  After June 21  and until further notice  Pacific Bell must submit a monthly updated issues/action log highlighting the issues that were listed in the staff s June 21 final summary.  The order also directs the staff to inform Mr. Brown by Aug. 3 of any progress made toward resolving problems regarding database and documentation  installation trouble  and missed due dates.  The largest number of joint CLEC problems fell under those three areas.  The staff also will advise Mr. Brown by Jan. 4  2002  as to what extent the other issues in the June 21 summary have been resolved.  (Rulemaking nos. 93-04-003 and 95-04-043  Investigation nos. 93-04-002 and 95-04-044)______________________________________________________NEW MEXICO -- PRC to reconsider area code decisionThe Public Regulation Commission has voted unanimously to reconsider its decision ordering a "split" to relieve number exhaustion in the "505" area code.  The commission is drafting an order today that will include a schedule for hearings on the matter  a PRC staff member told TR.A group of businesses  citizens  and governmental entities calling itself "The  505  Coalition " asked the PRC to reconsider the order.  (5/18/01)  The coalition is disappointed with the PRC s decision to assign the new "957" area code to the most populated areas of the state--Albuquerque  Santa Fe  and Los Alamos.The coalition said the PRC violated state law by allowing newly sworn in Commissioner Rory McMinn  who hadn t participated in any of the public hearings or meetings in the case to cast the deciding vote in the matter.  According to the coalition  state law (section 8-8-18 NMSA 1978) requires the recusal of a PRC commissioner or hearing examiner in any case in which the individual is unable to make a fair decision.  The coalition said that  according to PRC records  Mr. McMinn or his staff never reviewed the case s file.______________________________________________________MASSACHUSETTS -- DTE to defer DSL cost issuesTwo Department of Telecommunications and Energy hearing officers have granted Verizon Massachusetts  request to defer consideration of two digital subscriber line (DSL) cost issues.  Verizon asked the officers to delay establishing final rates for conditioning of loops that meet Carrier Service Area standards and final rates for line sharing collocation augment application and engineering services.Verizon said it would be more efficient to address the two issues in the DTE s comprehensive TELRIC (total-element long-run incremental cost) docket.  The items are the final issues remaining in the DTE s 1998 advanced services rate investigation.Covad Communications Co. opposed Verizon s request.  Covad said removing the issues to the TELRIC docket would deprive the parties of the extensive record on loop conditioning costs developed in the advanced service docket.  Covad also said the move would "entail unnecessary time and expense."The DTE hearing officers said that the collocation and line sharing costs are within the scope of the TELRIC docket and that any matter contained in the advanced service docket would be available to the parties in the TELRIC docket.  The officers also noted that the rates proposed by Verizon in the TELRIC docket for the two DSL items are lower than the interim rates set in the advanced service docket.Verizon will have to begin offering the lower proposed rates immediately  subject to true-up when the TELRIC docket is concluded.  (Docket no. D.T.E. 98-57  Phase III)______________________________________________________ARIZONA -- ACC approves price hikeThe Corporation Commission has adopted a settlement that increases Southwestern Telephone Co. s business and residential rates  sets a 9% rate of return  and increases the company s revenue by $20 000.  Southwestern  the commission staff  and the Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO) were parties to the settlement.Southwestern originally asked for a 9.96% rate of return  based on a $3.9 million fair-value rate base (FVRB).  The commission staff and the RUCO proposed their own rates of return and FVRBs  and the three parties worked together on a settlement.  The agreement adopted the staff s proposed FVRB of $4.1 million.The settlement will raise residential rates by 25 cents to $11.25 and will raise business rates by 90 cents to $24.90.  Southwestern serves about 4 600 access lines in the Quartzsite and Salome exchanges.  (Docket no. T-01072B-00-0379)______________________________________________________FLORIDA -- NeuStar to release  growth code  to BellSouthThe Public Service Commission has ordered North American Numbering Plan administrator NeuStar  Inc.  to release a "growth code" to BellSouth Telecommunications  Inc.  for the Magnolio-ORLDFLMADS1 switch in the Orlando rate center.BellSouth requested a growth code to meet a customer s request for 2 500 consecutive DID (direct inward dial) numbers in an NXX with a four as the last digit (NX4).  NeuStar denied BellSouth s request because the company hadn t met the rate center months-to-exhaust (MTE) criteria required to obtain a growth code.  To qualify for a growth code  carriers must have no more than a six-month inventory of telephone numbers in the rate center.  BellSouth appealed NeuStar s decision to the PSC.The commission said the MTE criteria create a disadvantage for carriers with multiple-switch rate centers.  One switch in a such a center may be near exhaust while the average MTE for the rate center is above six months  the PSC said.  When NeuStar denied BellSouth s code request  the MTE for the Magnolia-ORLDFLMADS1 switch was four months.  (Docket no. 010309-TL)______________________________________________________NORTH CAROLINA -- Commission sets number-pooling scheduleThe Utilities Commission has ordered Telcordia Technologies  Inc.  to implement 1 000-number block pooling in the "919" area code by Oct. 26.  Number pooling will postpone "for as long as possible" the activation of the "984" overlay for the "919" area code and the introduction of mandatory 10-digit dialing  the commission said.  (Docket no. P-100  Sub 137)______________________________________________________CALIFORNIA -- PUC to mull advice letter proceduresA Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge has asked interested parties to comment on whether a hearing should be held to discuss various proposals to change the advice letter process.  Regulated companies usually file advice letters to make routine tariff changes.According to the ALJ  a consequence of the proliferation of the telecom industry is that the PUC s "procedures for different types of telecommunications advice letters also have proliferated rapidly  sometimes even on a utility-specific basis."  He said the goal of this proceeding was to unify and simplify existing procedures  which are scattered over many decisions and resolutions.The ALJ said some parties have asked the commission to retain certain advice letter procedures  but they disagreed about which ones should be kept.  The ALJ has asked interested parties to respond by June 14 to his questions about advice letter procedures that are inconsistent with the commission s general or telecom rules.  Commenting parties also must discuss whether and why they think a hearing would be warranted.  (Rulemaking no. 98-07-038  Rulemaking for purposes of revising General Order 96-A regarding informal filings at the Commission)______________________________________________________ALABAMA -- Rule would revise reporting requirementsThe Public Service Commission has asked for comments by June 25 on a proposed rule that would require long distance carriers to identify  for informational purposes  their interstate long distance per-minute rates in their tariffs.  The proposed rule also would require carriers to identify the product name  per-minute rates  minimum monthly charges  and billing increments applicable to intrastate long distance calling plans "within the same section under which the service is described in the tariff."The new rule would help the PSC respond to customer complaints  the PSC said.  "Rates associated with the [intrastate long distance] plan such as the minimum monthly charge  call duration  billing increments  etc.  may not be found in the same general area of the tariff as the rate schedule " the PSC said.  (Docket no. 15957)______________________________________________________NEBRASKA -- Gov. Johanns mulls fiber-optics billThe Legislature has passed and sent to Gov. Mike Johanns (R.) legislation to prohibit governmental agencies or political subdivisions from providing telecom service for a fee or from becoming certified as contract or common telecom carriers.  (3/23/01)  The measure would allow governmental agencies or political agencies to own  sell  and lease dark fiber.  The Public Service Commission would have to approve the lease price and profit distribution for governmental bodies leasing dark fiber.Sens. Curt Bromm (Ind.  District 23) and Bob Wickersham (Ind.  District 49) introduced LB 827.______________________________________________________WISCONSIN -- New coalition seeks reliable telecom serviceA coalition of Ameritech-Wisconsin customers and competitors has formed to "fight for affordable and reliable telephone service."  The Wisconsin CALLS coalition includes the American Association of Retired Persons  the Citizens  Utility Board  the Wisconsin Merchants Federation  the Wisconsin Realtors  Association  the Wisconsin Apartment Association  and AT&T Corp. as members.The coalition supports a legislative reform initiative to (1) establish specific service standards and penalties for poor service by Ameritech  (2) permit customers and competitors to sue Ameritech directly when it violates the law  (3) prohibit Ameritech from double charging customers and developers for connecting new real estate developments to the network  (4) impose measure to increase local competition  and (5) order structural separation of Ameritech.Doug Johnson  senior vice president and general counsel for the Wisconsin Merchants Federation  said  "Our members depend upon the reliability and affordability of the local telecommunications system.  In the past year they have suffered major economic damage as a result of loss of service  slow response time  and high prices for basic service.  And since there is little or no local phone competition  our members have no alternatives."______________________________________________________ILLINOIS -- CUB urges commission to order Ameritech rate cutThe Citizens Utility Board yesterday renewed its call for the Commerce Commission to reduce Ameritech-Illinois  rates by $957 million.  CUB was responding to a recommendation by two hearing examiners against including any revenue reduction when renewing the company s alternative regulation plan.  (5/22/01)A review of Ameritech s finances conducted by CUB and other consumer agencies found that the company "has underreported its revenues and overstated its expenses to mask its true earnings and ward off any rate reduction."  When the company s books are adjusted for those discrepencies  CUB said  the study shows rates should be reduced by $957 million  a decrease that would save the typical customer $120 a year.CUB Executive Director Martin Cohen said  "The hearing examines ignored all the evidence showing that Ameritech s rates are excessive.  But we ve seen the ICC overrule their hearing examiners on many occasions.  We look forward to arguing our case directly to the ICC in the coming weeks."The ICC is scheduled to rule on the hearing examiners  proposed order in July  according to CUB.______________________________________________________DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC adopts service-termination rulesThe Public Service Commission has adopted rules governing service termination by competitive local exchange carriers.  The rules  which were first adopted on an emergency basis in March  also modify existing regulations on tariff reviews  certification  and annual reviews.  (3/30/01)The rules will take effect when they are posted in the D.C. Register.

(5/2/01) The PSC said Verizon and AT&T Corp. disagree as to whether a loop concentrator is a subloop element  which must be unbundled.  Verizon argued that it isn t and that the FCC requires it to unbundle only two subloop elements--the loop distribution and the loop feeder.The PSC said  "Verizon is incorrect in asserting that the FCC only included two subloop elements as UNEs; in fact the FCC requires all subloop elements to be unbundled."  The problem  the PSC said  is that there isn t a list of subloop elements.  Although AT&T argued that the loop concentrator qualifies  "AT&T didn t define the term or explain its function " the PSC said.Once parties provide a list defining each subloop element and explaining their functions  the PSC will set a final list of elements.  Verizon will have to provide costs for those elements in its UNE cost studies.

The PSB said although its single area code  "802 " isn t in immediate danger  it still may be susceptible to premature number exhaust.  The board noted a recent request for 98 central office codes advanced 802 s projected exhaust date from 2011 to 2007.  The PSB said two more similar requests would exhaust the available number supply completely.The board plans to select an interim number-pooling administrator within two months.  The PSB said it would establish a cost-recovery mechanism before pooling begins and appointed a hearing officer to oversee the docket.

In an informational tariff filing  SW Bell increased its wholesale DA listing rates from 0.11 cents to 4 cents per initial listing.  Informational tariffs take effect soon after filing  unless a party objects to it.The PUC set cost-based rates for SW Bell s wholesale DA listings in separate dockets.  SW Bell said its DA listings should be made available at "market-based" rates consistent with the FCC s Feb. 17  2000  unbundled network elements (UNEs) order.  WorldCom said the PUC s cost-based rates are permitted by the FCC s directory listings and UNEs orders.

The State Corporation Commission ordered the change in December 2000 when it opted for a "split"/"overlay" combination plan to relieve the impending number shortage in the 804 area.  (12/4/01)The 434 code will be launched June 1  marking the beginning of a seven-and-a-half month permissive-dialing period.  Mandatory use of the new code will begin Jan. 15  2002.  The 434 code will serve areas to the south and west of the Greater Richmond area  including the cities of Charlottesville  Danville  and Lynchburg.The 804 area code will continue to serve the Greater Richmond area  as well as the town of West Point and communities on the upper and middle peninsulas.  Verizon Virginia  Inc.  said the change will have no effect on rates or local calling areas.______________________________________________________OREGON -- PUC opens certificate-transfer rulemakingThe Public Utility Commission yesterday opened a rulemaking on transferring to other carriers certificates of authority to provide telecom service  a PUC staff member told TR.  The commission doesn t have any rules on this issue.  (5/21/01)The staff already has drafted a proposal based on the existing requirements for obtaining a certificate.  The proposal would require both parties to a transaction to file a joint application.  According to the staff  this would ensure that both parties concur with the specifics of the transfer.The transfer applications also would be considered on an expedited basis.  The draft rules would abolish the proposed order and exceptions process in these cases  eliminating 36 days from the proceeding.The commission scheduled a July 23 workshop and a Sept. 24 hearing to receive input on the proposed rule.  (Docket no. AR 415)______________________________________________________WISCONSIN -- Measure would prohibit  spamming Rep. Steve Foti (R.  Oconomowoc) and Sen. Mary Panzer (R.

Conf. regarding capacity allocation.  gh -----Original Message-----From:  Bagot  Nancy  Sent: Tuesday  August 28  2001 5:48 PMTo: Hyatt  Kevin; Watson  Kimberly; Harris  Steven; Butler  Janet; Corman  Shelley; Darveaux  Mary; Dornan  Dari; Fossum  Drew; Hartsoe  Joe; Hass  Glen; Heckerman  Bambi; Kilmer III  Robert; King Jr.  Frazier; Kirk  Anna; Lokey  Teb; McCoppin  Dorothy; Miller  Mary Kay; Neppl  Ray; Paladino  Ranelle; Pavlou  Maria; Place  Janet; Porter  Gregory J.; Prizont  Karina; Winckowski  MicheleSubject: FERC conference on El Paso capacity allocation (RP00-336)SummaryThough this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to El Paso s capacity allocation method (including those in the pipeline s Order 637 proceeding)  and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline s allocation  major substantive issues were not covered at this conference.  For instance  the battle between Full Requirements (FR) shippers and Contract Demand (CD) shippers came up marginally  but not in terms as substantive as the proposed conversion of FR shippers to CD contracts.Procedurally  there was also no decision on whether to proceed with a hearing  merits decision from the Commission or settlement  though it looks like a merits decision is the likely avenue for a decision.  Staff did not discuss case merits or ask pointed substantive questions.Allocation Studies (Models)El Paso opened the conference with a presentation/interpretation of seven capacity studies they have done to illustrate how its allocation proposal (March 27) would allocate the system s receipt and delivery points based on different scenarios.  For nominations  receipt and delivery points were specified and ranked by shippers  and the model used 20 pools.  The scheduling model looked at where constraints occurred (based on those shipper-supplied preferences)  solved the largest constraints first  then ran second and third iterations to complete allocation.There were questions on the studies  what they show  what the assumptions are  etc.  and in the end shippers believe they need information not shown by the completed studies.  Shippers have requested six more allocation studies  showing possible impacts of seasonalization (winter and summer) and the difference between CD and Full Requirements Coincidental and Non Coincidental Peaks (winter and summer  1995 - 2000).  El Paso interprets its studies as showing that the proposed capacity allocation method is workable  and in fact results in 247 MMcf/d of unallocated capacity (230 MMcf coming from the Line 2000 expansion proposal  and an extra 17 MMcf).  Shippers were skeptical of the "slack capacity" finding.Other Issues? Pooling: There was a small amount of discussion on the impact of moving from six to 20 pools.  It was noted that this should be addressed with Order 637 issues  expeditiously after capacity allocation method is resolved.? FR vs. CD: Though there were some FR vs. CD shippers discussions  they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by the TX  NM and AZ shippers (FR) and Aera Energy (CD shippers).  There was also no mention of converting FR shippers to CD service.  Note: never mentioned were the CD and FR complainants  proposals that El Paso (1) dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or (2) requiring mainline system expansion for existing service (RP01-484 and 486).? Release shippers:  Shippers contracting for released capacity were concerned about how they would be allocated  as well as those shippers picking up turnback contracts from the pipeline (which would have receipt and delivery points already allocated).? Receipt Point Designation:  The question was asked if shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools.  When asked what Commission policy is on pools vs. receipt points  both shippers and Staff clarified that they are neither mutually exclusive nor to serve as substitutes for one another - both should be available.  However  Staff noted that in the flexibility vs. reliability debate  it could be argued that El Paso should return to receipt point designation to maintain reliability.Procedure Going ForwardThe primary issue here ended up being procedural.The procedural schedule is as follows:?

The result has been a steady and==20steepdecline in the November NYMEX price from $5.63 per MMBtu on October 12 intothe $4.60s as of October 25. Cash prices have followed suit  falling from t=he=20mid-$5.50s to the $4.60s at the Henry Hub  and gas is now pricing below residua=l=20fuel oilin the Gulf Coast and especially on the East Coast. Although gas storage=20inventorieswill begin the winter at levels higher than expected  in CERA=01 s view ade=quatesupply for the winter is not yet assured  and the market remains subject to= a=20quickreturn to prices well above $5.00 with the first cold snap.Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe=r=2020accompanied by broad-based and continuing warm weather have driven the shif=t=20inmarket psychology. Last week=01 s injection rate was 26.5 Bcf  or approxima=tely=203.8Bcf per day  above the previous five-year average for those seven days and =58=20Bcfabove the 13 Bcf of injections recorded last year for the week ending Octob=er=2022.With warm weather this week and the return of more normal temperatures=20expectednext week  CERA now expects storage to reach a maximum level of 2 784 Bcf o=nOctober 31--still an all-time low entering the winter  by 26 Bcf (see Table==201).Is this inventory level "enough"? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter==20under 15-year normal weather conditions would fall to approximately 780 Bcf  22 Bcf==20abovethe previous all-time low. This end-of-March minimum implies total=20withdrawals inthe United States this winter of 2.0 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)  128 Bcf abo=ve=20last year=01 swithdrawals. But holding withdrawals this winter down to 2.0 Tcf in the fac=e=20of areturn to normal weather--and the demand rebound of 3.0 Bcf per day it woul=dbring--will be difficult. Although the beginning of a US supply rebound andgrowing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20winter holding withdrawals down requires both of the following:* Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanolproducers--that are now shut down because of high gas pricesmust remain shut down. These markets representapproximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol.* The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burningresidual fuel oil must remain off of gas.In CERA=01 s view  for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis ==20particularlyas power loads increase this winter  it must become apparent that winter=20demand canbe met  the current resid load can return to gas  and storage inventories c=an=20be heldreasonably near the previous record low.

I look forward to working with you in these efforts.What I really wanted to talk to you about is the JDF Walk.  Last year we discovered that our 2 1/2 year old son  Brandon  had diabetes.  As you remember  and certainly can relate to  this changed our lives forever.  In retrospect  I am glad that I got involved in Enron s effort even though it was in the last 3-4 weeks.  We have continued to stay involved with JDF by attending several events  by visiting the JDF office  and by JDF s proactive phone out-reach.  I would like to hear your take on sponsoring a team through Enron vs. directly through JDF.  I know that Enron matches the contributions if sponsored through Enron; is this possible if we were to go the other route?Please call or email as I know we are approaching the campaign time.Thanks Todd Hall      From:  Mike McConnell                           08/23/2000 06:12 PM Sent by: Cathy PhillipsTo: Julie Armstrong/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Katherine Benedict/HOU/ECT@ECT  Barton Clark/HOU/ECT@ECT  Dorothy Dalton/Enron Communications@Enron Communications  Shonnie Daniel/HOU/ECT@ECT  Zulie Flores/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Dortha Gray/GPGFIN/Enron@ENRON  D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT@ECT  Deryle Harsell/GPGFIN/Enron@ENRON  Ned Higgins/HOU/ECT@ECT  Kimberly Hillis/HOU/ECT@ect  Brenda J Johnston/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Phylis Karas/ET&S/Enron@ENRON  Susan Lopez/HOU/ECT@ECT  Peggy McCurley/HOU/ECT@ECT  Thomas Meers/GPGFIN/Enron@ENRON  Greg Nikkel/HOU/EES@EES  Kathleen Noble/Enron Communications@Enron Communications  Sophie Patel/ET&S/Enron@ENRON  Jody Pierce/HOU/ECT@ECT  Rosalinda Resendez/HOU/ECT@ECT  Bernice Rodriguez/HOU/ECT@ECT  Angela Sayegh/OTS/Enron@ENRON  Eddie Sera/Enron Communications@Enron Communications  Stacy Gibson/HOU/ECT@ECT  lcastil@enron.com  Yolanda Arriaga/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT  Liz Beddingfield/OTS/Enron@ENRON  Gina Calderon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications  Adriana Cortes/HOU/ECT@ECT  Lisa Sawyer/ET&S/Enron@ENRON  Kenneth Sommers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT  Candy C Willard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Blanca Bollom/NA/Enron@Enron  Rachel Feldt/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Deb Gebhardt/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECT  John Walt/Corp/Enron@ENRON  Debbie Yates/GPGFIN/Enron@ENRON Subject: JDF Kick-Off LuncheonBy now all of you should have received an invitation to the JDF 2000 Walk to Cure Diabetes Kick-Off Luncheon on Wednesday  September 6th  11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.

Shawn Cooper_____________________________________________________________________________________________Natural Gas WeekPG&E Files Reorganization Plan - Edison Further Toward the BrinkSeptember 24  2001Page 6 California utility Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) announced theirreorganization plan last week to the applause of its creditors. Suchapplause may prove to be an annoying buzz to Gov. Gray Davis  who was unableto coerce a bailout plan for Southern California Edison (SCE) from the statelegislature. Pacific Gas & Electric s announcement is likely to underminehis efforts to do so. Under the plan  the PG&E utility will be separated from PG&E Corp.  theparent corporation  into a stand-alone company that will not be affiliatedwith the parent. The utility will still run its retail electric and naturalgas operations but the parent company will take control of electricgeneration  electric transmission  and natural gas transmission operations. Those three sectors will be operated by PG&E as three distinct businesses.The electric transmission business will own and operate some 18 500 miles oftransmission assets. The gas transmission business will operate the formerutility gas operations  including 6 300 miles of transmission pipelines andthree gas storage facilities. The generation company will control 7 100 MW including the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant. Once the utility assets are reorganized  PG&E said that it will be able toissue debt that it will use to combine with new financing at Pacific Gas &Electric to pay its creditor claims of some $13 billion. The plan will alsorestructure some existing debt and use about $3.3 billion in on-hand cash tomeet its obligations. PG&E said that all of its creditor claims will be met under the plan througha combination of $9.1 billion cash and $4.1 billion long-term debt notes.Creditors with claims of $100 000 or less will receive cash payments for thefull amount of their claims on the effective date of the plan along withmost secured creditors. Unsecured creditors with allowed claims in excess ofthe $100 000 threshold will be paid 60% cash and 40% in notes. The division of the utility will still result in PG&E being regulated by theCalifornia Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)  but the new businesses -under parent PG&E - will be under the oversight of the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission (FERC). The move is likely a conscious decision to getas much of the company from under the thumb of the state. PG&E has beenchastised by Davis for its refusal to follow the path of SCE  which optedfor a state-led restructuring plan. Instead they filed for bankruptcyprotection with the courts. Both PG&E and SCE racked up enormous debts under California s deregulationplan since they were forced to cover high spot market power purchases thatthey could not recover through their retail rates  which the state froze.However  PG&E refused to play along with Davis s electricity plans  which isstarting to look like the smart decision. SCE signed a memorandum of understanding with Gov. Davis that said the statelegislature would create a viable bailout plan for the utility  which hassome $3.9 billion in debt. Unfortunately  after much political wrangling the legislature was unable to pass a bill before the end of its session onSept. 14. Davis has said that he will call them back for a special session of thelegislature at the beginning of October but that may not be in time for theailing utility. Published reports from last week said that two SCEcreditors  Reliant Energy and Mirant  may try to force the company intoinvoluntary bankruptcy. A spokesman for Reliant said that he could notcomment on the report. SCE is refusing to go down the bankruptcy path  however. "We do not intendto file voluntary bankruptcy " said Ted Craver  chief financial officer forSEC s parent company Edison International  during a conference call lastweek. "We ask our creditors to continue to forbear and work with us. We willvigorously oppose any involuntary bankruptcy petition " he said. Craver  however  did admit that the chances the company would have todeclare bankruptcy had grown much higher. - Christian Schmollinger.

FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline and utility companies to sell natural gas and electricity at market rates providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passing of information that provides a competitive advantage to their marketing affiliates. The changes under consideration stem from the commission s investigation of El Paso Natural Gas Co. s (EPG) controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into California  according to sources. The affiliate transaction has been blamed for California s dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year  which contributed to the state s unprecedentedly high electricity costs last year. The proposed code-of-conduct changes also reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated the pipeline industry in the 1980s. FERC s rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensitive information with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don t address the pipeline s power marketing affiliates. The commission is looking to expand the code-of-conduct rules to address all marketing affiliates  sources said. These sources say the template for the pending change can be found in the conditions FERC imposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). The commission approved the electricity-natural gas convergence merger  contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates. Those conditions didn t stop Dominion from agreeing Monday to purchase Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas Corp. (LD) for $2.3 billion. FERC s planned rule changes would apply to other electric utilities with pipeline investments  such as CMS Energy (CMS)  Duke Energy (DUK) and American Electric Power Co. (AEP). It is unclear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements  such as the one between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and privately held Koch Industries. The largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants. For example  El Paso  Williams Cos. (WMB) and Enron Corp. (ENE)  represent about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry and are among the nation s top power marketers and merchant power plant developers. As of last week  the commission was still debating the scope of the order  with some on the regulatory panel pushing for even stronger rules than the precedent established in the Dominion order. "It could very well rattle the sabre about whether transmission providers ought to have affiliates at all that do business on their own transmission systems " said a FERC source. -By Bryan Lee  Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647;Bryan.Lee@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc.

INDIA: Enron  Indian utility step up war of words.By Himangshu Watts09/10/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW DELHI  Sept 10 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and an Indian utility  locked in a payments battle  stepped up their war of words on Monday. The Dabhol Power Co (DPC)  65-percent owned by Enron  said in a statement late on Monday the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) was being "illogical" in saying high-priced power from the project caused heavy losses to the utility.Enron has accused MSEB of defaulting on payments for power  but the utility says the outstanding amount could be adjusted against payments due from Dabhol as DPC had not abided by some of its commitments in the contract. The $2.9-billion plant  India s largest direct foreign investment  has been idling since May  when MSEB  its sole buyer  stopped taking power saying it was too costly. DPC said its power was not expensive if the plant s capacity was properly utilised  and that it did not cause a heavy loss to the utility  but MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal said Dabhol s power made the utility lose 13.4 billion rupees last year. Bansal told reporters on the sidelines of an awards ceremony that the utility suffered the loss because DPC charged a high tariff of eight rupees per kilo-watt hour  which is more than three times costlier than power from other sources. DPC said its average tariff between May 1999 and May 2001 was 5.64 rupees while the Plant Load Factor (PLF) was 52 percent. Had the PLF been been 90 percent  DPC s tariff would then have been only 4.13 rupees  it said. "The MSEB chairman is also a member of DPC s board...and is very well aware of DPC s tariff " DPC said. It said it found it surprising that he had opted to "present DPC s tariff completely out of context." POWER SHORTAGE DPC said MSEB faced a shortage of more than 1000 MW of power and could have used electricity from the 740 MW Dabhol project  which has been idling since May  when MSEB  its sole buyer  stopped taking power saying its was too expensive. Running the plant at 90 percent PLF would have reduced the cost of Dabhol s power  Enron said in the statement. "...it is clear the MSEB is well in a position to draw power at 90 percent PLF...thus resulting in a most competitive current tariff of 4.40 rupees pwer kilo-Watt hour." Bansal admitted that MSEB faced a shortage but said a higher PLF would not have made much of a difference to its losses. "It would be marginally lower  but not very much. You see we bought at eight rupees a unit. Supposing even if it was five rupees a unit  instead of 13-billion loss  it would be a 10 billion " he said. DPC said Dabhol s power was sold not only to subsidised agricultural users  but also to industrial and commercial customers  who paid a high price for electricity. "This results in a much average higher revenue realisation for MSEB  and is therefore illogical to suggest the MSEB bears a loss of 13.4 billion rupees on DPC power " the statement said. It said the tariff could be reduced to 3.80 rupees pwer kilo-Watt hour if state and federal levies on naphtha were reduced. Enron has announced its intention to sell its 65-percent stake in the Dabhol Power Co following the dispute over payments of power from the 740-MW first phase of the project which was built last year. The 1 444 MW second phase of the project was 97-percent complete when construction was abandoned due to the dispute. Apart from Enron  which holds 65 percent in DPC  U.S. Conglomerate  General Electric and construction firm Bechtel each own 10 percent. MSEB owns the remaining 15 percent.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Avici shares fell 79 cents  or 28 percent  to $1.99 after thecompany said it expects a third-quarter loss almost doubleanalysts  estimates. The stock has fallen 98 percent in the pastyear.     The firings today come as Avici s biggest customers  QwestCommunications International Inc.  AT&T Corp. and Enron Corp.  cutjobs and equipment budgets. The three companies make up more thanthree-fourths of Avici s revenue  said Sam Wilson  an analyst withMerrill Lynch & Co. Inc. Qwest said today it will eliminate 4 000jobs and reduce its 2002 capital spending to $5.5 billion fromearlier forecasts of $7.5 billion.    ``I would not say that we lost any customers over thequarter    said Pete Chadwick  vice president of marketing forAvici. ``They are seeing a little bit less growth and they arejust being more cautious because they are obviously focused oncapital conservation.       Last month  Avici retreated from statements that Enron andWilliams Communications Group Inc. will buy $45 million of itsproducts by mid-2002. Avici is the No. 3 maker of high-speed data-traffic routers behind Cisco Systems Inc. and Juniper NetworksInc.                        Third-Quarter Sales     Avici said it had fewer and smaller orders than itanticipated and expects to report third-quarter revenue of$9 million to $10 million  less than the $22.5 million to$23.5 million it previously forecast. Sales in the second quarterof 2000 were $4.36 million.

In anticipation of such a d=evelopment  we shall prepare an alternate Petition so it is available if th=ere is a customer Petitioner.=20Following yesterday s conversation  we examined the availability of going i=nto the federal court system  rather than the California court system  foll=owing action by the Commission.  There is access to federal courts because =the case will involve federal constitutional rights.  But going directly to= federal court has its pitfalls.  First  the 11th amendment prevents naming= the State (and presumably its subdivisions) as defendants.  This limitatio=n can be circumvented by naming individuals as the defendants (such as the =Attorney General who is the chief law enforcement officer) using Ex Parte Y=oung  209 U.S. 123.  Second  the federal court will have wide discretion to= abstain (this is known as a Pullman Abstention) from hearing the case in o=rder to allow the California courts to decide the California constitutional= issues.  Third  the federal courts may conclude this is really a dispute o=ver rate making and require that state remedies be exhausted (28 USC 1342).=  There may be other pitfalls.=20In our estimation  the federal courts would seek to abstain because the cas=e involves such important California legal and policy issues that the Legis=lature decided it was necessary to confer original and priority jurisdictio=n in the California Supreme Court.  This presents a tactical dilemma becaus=e of the risk of alienating the Supreme Court by first going to District Co=urt which then decides to abstain.  Also  it could create timing problems b=ecause relief must be sought from the Supreme Court no later than 30 days a=fter a rehearing application is denied by the Commission.  The District Cou=rt would probably take more than 30 days to decide whether to abstain  thus= opening a new argument of timeliness when the state action is initiated.=20This suggests the possibility of filing simultaneously in both courts.  Suc=h a strategy should use separate claimants and separate attorneys to avoid =the claim of forum shopping.  Even if the cases involved different claimant=s and different attorneys  such a strategy would probably have little likel=ihood of success because it would make it even easier for the federal court= to abstain since there would already be an existing state court proceeding=.  By way of example  I was involved in a proceeding in the 9th Circuit con=cerned with Indian gaming which was deferred because of the proceeding that= was in the California Supreme Court involving the constitutionality of Pro=position 5 and then Proposition 1A.  Because the California Supreme Court u=pheld Proposition 1A  the 9th Circuit never acted.  Since the instant case =implicates state law and policy  the likelihood of abstention  even if two =separate cases are brought  is very high .=20The foregoing analysis assumes that the Commission seeks to retroactively s=uspend existing contracts.  We have not yet considered whether the pending =bill  if enacted by the Legislature  would change the analysis.=20We shall keep you advised.

jeff.dasovich@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state s ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour  the agency said Wednesday. The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis  the department said. In a press release  the department s California Energy Resources Scheduling division  its power-marketing arm  said it resold 224 871 megawatt-hours  or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts  not the long-term contracts  the department said. Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation  as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways  the department said. The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state s three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. According to the DWR  power secured under Davis  long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals  such as monthly or quarterly contracts  represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly  the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position  the department said. The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric  Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.

I don t understand the meaning of the phrase "or be deemed to elect."  If inserting the phrase serves an important purpose  then perhaps it s appropriate to leave it in.  But we haven t discussed any reason for needing it.  As such  given the last-minute nature of the change  it should be deleted.There is one heckuvalot of detail in the rate-related language that Edison provided that we didn t have a chance to discuss in our negotiations.  It may turn out that it s all fine  but I frankly haven t haven t had the chance to adequately wrap my meager mind around the language  so I just want to let folks know that many more comments on those pieces may pop up from my end in the near term.Finally  I just want to raise a flag on section 25465 (a) (6) regarding the green portfolio standard.  We never discussed/analyzed those additional percentages and consequently we never established a "zone of comfort" around including those numbers.

If you have any questions  just holler.Best Jeff

paragraph  auction in eighth paragraph. Formore on California s electricity crisis  see {EXTRA <GO>}.)     Rosemead  California  Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- SouthernCalifornia Edison Co. s banks agreed to delay taking actionagainst the utility until at least Feb. 13 for defaulting on linesof credit  an executive of its parent company said.     ``The banks have agreed to forbear   through that date  TedCraver  Edison International s chief financial officer  said in aconference call with investors.     The group of 23 banks have the right to demand acceleratedpayments or seek other remedies after Southern California Edison California s second-largest utility  failed to make $230 millionof payments on maturing notes last week. That produced a ``cross-default   on its lines of credit.     Both the utility and PG&E Corp. s Pacific Gas & Electricdefaulted last week on commercial paper  a type of money-marketsecurity. In addition  Southern California Edison failed to pay$366 million to power generators.     The two utilities have piled up more than $11.5 billion inpower-buying debt because rising demand and short supplies havedriven up the price they pay  and the state s deregulation lawcaps the rates they can charge customers.     For more than a week  the California Independent SystemOperator has kept its highest alert in place. The Stage Threealert is imposed by the ISO  which runs three-quarters of thestate s power grid  when reserves fall to within 1.5 percentof demand.                      Bankruptcy Outlook     The state is now running an auction to solicit bids formultiyear power contracts on behalf of the utilities. Producerscan submit offers in the auction  which ends at noon Californiatime  to sell power for as long as 10 years.     Meanwhile  Southern California Edison and the banks aregetting the final paperwork ``mopped up   on the forbearanceagreement  Craver said in yesterday s conference call.     The utility doesn t intend to file for bankruptcy  Craversaid. ``We do not believe that solves anything    he said  as itdoesn t change the need for political and regulatory action toaddress the utility s cash crunch.     ``That s why we instituted this additional step of thetemporary payment suspension    Craver said. ``We believe we re ina position to operate the business without running out of cash  for at least three weeks  he said. He described the utility s netcash flow as ``at least breakeven   after the payment suspensions.     Craver was asked during the teleconference about the chancesthat power generators or other creditors might force the utilityinto an involuntary bankruptcy.                          Making Progress     Generators are aware of the ``not-so-subtle threats thatbubble about   regarding the state using eminent domain to takecontrol of power plants or contracts. ``It s in everybody s bestinterest   to find a way out that avoids bankruptcy  Craver said.``That s the way everybody s operating.       California Governor Gray Davis and state lawmakers areworking on potential solutions  including locking in long-termpower contracts  to help keep the two utilities from bankruptcy.The state s Department of Water Resources has an initial stake of$400 million to buy electricity for the utilities.     ``We re continuing to make progress and it s encouragingthat s being recognized    said Steve Maviglio  a spokesman forDavis.     ``There is now a very great deal of urgency   among stateleaders to develop a comprehensive framework of solutions  RobertFoster  Edison s senior vice president of public affairs  saidduring the conference call.     A framework may be in place by Feb. 1  Foster said. ``Ihaven t seen anything quite this intense in 30 years   in thestate capital  he added.                         Paying the Bills     Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg is working on a bill thatcalls for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric togive up hydroelectric plants. In exchange  the state would sellrevenue bonds that repay past spending and finance power purchaseson their behalf.     ``I don t think at this point we re really able to respond  to that proposal without more details  Craver said. In response toa question on the transfer of hydroelectric plants  utilityofficials said the issues would include secured bondholders  lienson Edison s assets.     Utility officials said they have also been asked about whowill repay the $400 million of initial state spending on powerpurchases.     Based on the legislative intent  it is Edison s understanding``that this power be paid for directly by the customers  not theutilities    Stephen Pickett  vice president and general counselof Southern California Edison  said during the teleconference.     ``It is not completely clear that that is the case    Pickettsaid.     Craver also stressed that Edison  the parent of the utility hasn t gone into default on its obligations. ``We re not havingdifficulty meeting our obligations    he said  and its cash isabout twice the amount of commercial paper outstanding.--Dennis Walters in Ojai  California  at (805) 646-1475  ordwalters@bloomberg.net  through the San Francisco newsroom (415)912-2980/pkc/cs/dwStory illustration: For a chart comparing the performance ofEdison and PG&E with the Dow Jones Utilities for the past year click on {UTIL <Index> COMP D <GO>} or enter the command.

PG&E created the balancing account for thispurpose but also stated that they would transfer (on a monthly basis) anyongoing procurement costs which were not recovered through the TRA (i.e. from ongoing revenues) to this new balancing account as well.  It is unclearwhat PG&E s purpose is for doing such except  maybe to stop theundercollection in the TRA from getting any bigger and hope that they willhave a better shot of recovering undercollections in the new balancingaccount.Again let us know if you want us to comment on the advice letter withrespect to this issue and the direct access issue mentioned in the previouse-mail.  Energy Division only has five business days to review the AdviceFiling -- so any comments/protest of the filing must go in early next week.Jeanne Bennett

This is amassive benefit to the San Diegans  the first Californians to bear the bruntof our state s energy crisis last summer."The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)  signed by the Department of WaterResources for Gov. Davis with Sempra Energy and SDG&E executives while agroup of San Diego ratepayers  and State Senators Steve Peace (D-El Cajon)and Dede Alpert (D-Coronado) looked on  includes a number of provisions toeliminate the undercollection that could have cost each customerapproximately $750 (as much as $400 for each residential customer  $1 400for each small-commercial customer and $12 000 for each medium-sizedcommercial customer).In addition  it would settle several regulatory cases before the CaliforniaPublic Utilities Commission (PUC)  gives the State the opportunity topurchase 15 780 acres of environmentally-sensitive lands owned by thecompany along the Colorado River  and provides below-market power to theState through December 2010 from the San Onofre nuclear power plant. Theregulatory provisions are subject to PUC approval.It also calls for the purchase of SDG&E s transmission lines forapproximately $1 billion  or 2.3 times book value. However  the deal is notcontingent on that purchase of SDG&E s transmission network  which includes170 electric lines exceeding 69 kilovolts in capacity and spansapproximately 1 800 circuit miles from southern Orange County to the Mexicanborder. The system also includes about 135 electric substations andtransmission interties with Southern California Edison s system at the SanOnofre Nuclear Generating Station."Throughout these long and complex negotiations  Governor Davis and we havehad the mutual objective of reducing the financial impact of California scrisis on SDG&E s customers and helping the State gain more control over itsenergy destiny " said Stephen L. Baum  chairman  president and chiefexecutive officer of Sempra Energy. "Today s agreement represents a winningproposition for our customers  the State and our company: it reduces thefuture financial burden on our customers  protects the State s economicfuture  and creates a clear path for future growth and profitability for ourcompany. Going forward  we are committed to working with Governor Davis andthe State to implement his recovery plan."The MOU signed today is the second with California s investor-ownedutilities. An agreement with Southern California Edison is pending approvalbefore the State Legislature. Unlike the Edison agreement  however  the MOUwith Sempra Energy does not need legislative approval (except for theacquisition of transmission lines)."This is an example of the good that can come when parties are responsibleand remain at the bargaining table " Governor Davis said. "This is abalanced business transaction that benefits ratepayers and provides a stableenvironment for the State s third largest utility."Governor Davis said the MOU will not result in any additionalelectric-base-rate increases for SDG&E customers to recover the $750 millionundercollection. Without the MOU  future balloon payments to recover thissum could have been as much as $750 per customer.The regulatory balancing account for SDG&E s undercollected power costs hadgrown to approximately $750 million since September 2000  when the Stateimposed a retail rate cap of 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour  retroactive to May2000. California state law AB 265  signed by Governor Davis last year provided for SDG&E s recovery of all its prudently incurred power costs  butdelegated responsibility to the PUC for determining the method and timelinefor recovery.The agreement includes a complex package of elements to eliminate theballoon payment  such as the settlement of the reasonableness-review caseSDG&E had with the PUC. To settle that case  the utility has agreed toforego collecting $100 million of the balancing account.In addition  the agreement notes that:SDG&E agrees to give back 90 percent of the profits on two long-term powercontracts earned since the energy crisis flared last June. That means SDG&Ewill forego collecting another $219 million in the balancing account. (TheCalifornia Department of Water Resources will purchase those contracts as ofJune 1.);SDG&E and its sister utility  SoCalGas  will invest at least $3 billion oversix years into capital improvements. In addition  if the State decides notbuy the transmission lines (andSDG&E builds the Valley Rainbow line) the utility  backed by Sempra Energy will put another $500 million into transmission line improvements  subjectto PUC approval). Excluding the transmission system improvements  this is anincrease of $600 million more than the utilities invested in capitalimprovements in the previous five years; andSDG&E will drop all legal claims against the State."We know that many of our customers are extremely concerned about thepotential of large balloon payments looming in the future to address ourpast undercollections " said Edwin A. Guiles  group president of SempraEnergy s regulated business units and chairman of SDG&E. "We are pleasedthat today s agreement provides the framework to resolve major regulatoryissues to the benefit of our customers. Many challenges remain  but  thisagreement demonstrates that  by working together  we can surmount thesechallenges in a way that benefits all the key stakeholders in California senergy future."The MOU also calls for the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to continueto buy power for SDG&E through the agency until certain conditions are met.DWR has been purchasing power for SDG&E customers since early February.SDG&E is a regulated utility operating in San Diego and southern Orangecounties. Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE)  based in San Diego  is a Fortune 500energy services holding company with annualized 2001 revenues of about $13billion. Through its eight principal subsidiaries - Southern California GasCompany  San Diego Gas & Electric  Sempra Energy Solutions  Sempra EnergyTrading  Sempra Energy International  Sempra Energy Resources  SempraCommunications and Sempra Energy Financial - the Sempra Energy companies 12 000 employees serve more than nine million customers in the UnitedStates  Europe  Canada  Mexico  South America and Asia.

However  now that it is moving they have got themessage.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to createacoalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will takeplace.  In addition to Williams  I understand that Questar  WSPA  and otherretail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  Myclient Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition  but they don t carrythat much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groupswill surface soon.As for the bill itself  the problem is two fold.  First  the CPUC decideswhat infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They takeinput from customers  but Loretta is a command and control type all theway and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstatepipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-platedstate-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) barinterstate pipelines from coming into the state  it has provisions whichwill prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  Thelarge customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis withexit fees.  If they don t take this  they can only get interruptibleservicefrom the utilities.  Many if not all large customers  especially generatorscannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have onlyinterruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that theRLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of thecommission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the newinvestments will be used as justification by the utilities for anotherattempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  TheCommission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have notundertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable toeconomically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My viewis based on Sempra s reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decisionand statements by Lynch s office.  This could interfere with Enron gassalesover the interstates  and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plansfor building across the border into California  although that does notappear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make itmorecostly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which hadhoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion oftheir needs.Please call if you have further questions.

Do we know if the other pipelines have been activein any discussions on this bill?What about the generators?  Have then been involved  since presumably their in need of lots more capacity (and they re referenced in thebill)?What about large customers?  They been screaming for moreinfrastructure  too  and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for notdelivering it.Do we know if pipelines  generators  large customers are supporting oropposing the bill?  I ll try to check around  too  in between theelectric mayhem.There doesn t seem to be anything in the bill that prevents theinterstates from building into the state.If that s true  wouldn t the PUC take those projects into account whendoing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (andnoncore to take) capacity that isn t already being met by others (i.e. interstates) bringing pipe into the state?Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.

For those of you that want the Cliff Notes Version:These Orders appear to be an attempt to accomplish three things:1.  Expedite Siting for New Powerplants and Expansions or Modifications of Existing Powerplants2.  Maximize Output and Minimize Outages at Existing Facilities3.  Centralize Authority and/or Mitigate Issues Impacting Powerplant Siting and ConstructionThe tone is both one of we feel your pain in the complexity of permitting powerplants; and that we will tolerate no excuses for not running at full capacity.  (ie; the carrot and the stick)They also includes some targeted incentives to encourage powerplant operators to sell their power under contract to the State Dept. of Water.Some of the critical issues impacting the effectiveness of these orders will be:- How much capacity is truly "idling" and will be able to be brought back on line or increase its output?- Will the state be able to better manage air quality issues and create flexibility within the framework allowed by the Clean Air Act in order to positively change the air quality issues impacting power plant construction and operation?- How quickly can the accelerated permitting procedures be implemented and how soon will we see movements in the market to increase new generation given the other issues in CA?We will continue to analyze the impacts of these orders  but wanted to get information to you in a timely manner.D-22-01  Increased Output/Expedited Siting Mandates   CEC exemption from siting requirements for increased output by existing power generators. - limited to less than 50MWs using existing installed capacity b/w 06/01-10/01/01 Expedited processing of applications for certification of existing thermal powerplants that require retooling and a current license to operate.Accelerated review from all agencies involved in the licensing of proposed thermal powerplants.Action by the State Water Resources Control Board  to insure wastewater issues do not preclude thermal powerplants from operating.Requirements for the State Dept. of Water Resources to purchase power from powerplants using renewables and other resources that may currently have not other market for their power.Expires  12/31/01 unless extendedAnalysis:This Order is intended to take away the excuses for why some powerplants are currently not operating or not operating at full capacity.  It does not waive air quality requirements (they are addressed in a separate order).  D-23-01  Appropriate Maintenance and Efficient Operation RequirementsISO Requirements:- Require generators to submit planned outage schedules to the ISO- Prepare a coordinated outage plan to be updated quarterly- Identify generation maintenance criteria to be met by generation facilities- Maintain records of any unplanned generation facility outages and provide those records to Electricity Oversight Board- Conduct independent audits of generation facilities that have fallen below performance benchmarks est. by the ISO- Consider seeking the authority under state law of federal regulation to impose fines on those generation facility owners whose generation facilities have fallen     below performance benchmarks est. by the ISORequires that the Electricity Oversight Board review the ISO Tariffs and Protocols to identify any necessary revisions to increase the ISO s ability to ensure adequate power during peak demand.Instructs the CPUC to ensure that generation facilities still owned by utilities are operated as required to maintain reliability.Requires the Electricity Oversight Board to propose legislation to expand its authority to issue audits of generation facilities that do not meet est. benchmarks for availability and performance  and issue fines against those plants  after a hearing.Analysis:Again  the tone of this order is that the state won t tolerate outages as an excuse for not generating.  It is also an attempt to better manage planned outages to prevent situations that happened last fall when too many plants where off-line for maintenance at the same time.D-24-01  Air Pollution Flexibility and Mitigation MeasuresMandates that local air districts modify emissions limits that limit hours of operation in air quality permits to ensure that power generation facilities that provide power under contract to the Dept. of Water Resources are not restricted in their ability to operate.- Requires air districts to require a mitigation fee for all applicable emissions in excess of the previous limits- If air districts do not comply  the Board (CARB?) shall impose modifications on the permits in lieu of districtsThe Board shall establish an emissions reduction credit bank using emissions reductions from all available sources:- Credits will be made available to powerplant peaking sources that need emissions offsets in order to add new or expand peaking capacity for the Summer Peak Season in 2001- In the case of powerplants that agree to sell their power under contract to the Dept. of Water Resources  CA will make available where necessary and available the required emissions credits at up to a 50 percent reduction - In order to maximize the amount of electrical generating capacity  emissions reduction credits for new generation capacity shall be provided to facilities where necessary and available.- Proceeds from the sales of these emission reduction credits shall be made available to fund emissions reduction programs in the air district where the new or expanded facility is located.Expires 12/31/2001 unless extendedAnalysis:This order requires the air districts to modify permit limits on run hours for air quality reasons by allowing those powerplants that sell to the Dept. of Water to pay a mitigation fee and creates an emission reduction credit bank available for use by other sources.  There are a lot of details that remain to be clarified  including how the state is going to locate emissions reduction credits where developers were unsuccessful.  However  it is a step in the right direction by creating flexibility and beginning to drive authority back to the state level.D-25-01  Acceleration the Construction and Upgrading of Approved PowerplantsExpedites review and approval of post-certification amendments to increase output from thermal powerplants by the Energy Commission.Authorizes the Energy Commission to suspends the requirements of the statutes and regulations that normally control post-certifications to the extent that they impact prompt mitigation of this emergency.Requires the Energy Commission to establish milestones for both initiation of construction within one year of certification  and for the construction phase of the project.  Failure to meet milestones without prior approval by Energy Commission based on a showing of good cause shall constitute forfeiture of the certification.Expires 12/31/01 unless extendedAnalysisAgain  no excuses for not getting your powerplant modifications approved and completed in a timely manner.D-26-01  Accelerating the Availability of New Generation SourcesRequires all relevant agencies shorten the review periods to 7 days for required environmental impact documents prepared under CEQA for all powerplants that are not subject to the Energy Commission (under 50MWs) and that are proposed to be on line by summer 2001. Energy Commission shall expedite its licensing process in the following ways:- Expedite processing of applications for peaking or renewable powerplants for construction and operation by July 31  2001.-Peaking or renewable powerplants that have a current contract with the ISO and can be online by July 2001 may also apply to be permitted by the Energy Commission under the emergency siting process.-Rules which provide a license for a simple cycle thermal powerplant within four months  shall apply to any proposed simple-cycle thermal powerplant that can be brought on line by August 31  2002  and that have an application for certification complete by Dec. 31. 2001.-Under regulations for the expedited licensing of powerplants  emission offset credits are not required at the time of filing an application for certification-The Energy Commission shall conduct a study of potential peaking power sites in the state and prepare a report by 02/21/01  identifying those areas of the state that would benefit from the installation of peaking powerplants to augment supplies and ensure reliability through the summer of 2003.IOUs must complete necessary interconnection studies within 7 days of receipt of completed application.Expires 12/31/01 unless extended.Analysis:This is an attempt to accelerate the permitting of smaller sources and peaking units.

vicki.sharp@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,From a legal standpoint  they did not raise any new arguments - basically they state that our turning back the universities is costing the states money.  Everything depends on whether the  judge is likely to rule politically or legally.  As you know  we did not force the state to buy power  for customers - they decided to do so themselves.

The issue with retrofitting and burning fuel oil is going to be the fact that fuel oil has greater emissions and thus more offsets will be needed.

Our latest info is that there are still 3 votes in SUPPORT of direct access. So  this measure would fail if that SUPPORT stays in place.  ARM and others plan a campaign to attack this draft decision.From Commonwealth:I have that Linda Serizawa  Commissioner Wood s advisor  has stated thatCommissioner Wood is at this moment drafting the decision on direct access.She indicated that a draft order would be released  but would not say when.She stated that ABX1-1 directed the CPUC to set a date at which time acustomer would no longer have the right to switch to an ESP  and indicatedthat this order  as it is currently drafted  establishes that date.Apparently there was great hesitant when making the statement "as it ispresently drafted " indicating to that Wood is getting a lot of pressure notto set the date.

Attached is the newest draft of such a letter. We need to send this letter out FRIDAY so in order to do that please look over the letter carefully and let me know if your organization wishes to be included as a signatory. I need every set of eyes out there to look this letter over for spelling  grammar and content -- my eyes have seen it too many times and are apt to miss things. So  here is the process --- Let me know of any minor changes ASAP. If there are content changes please email them to the ENTIRE group for sign off. Please understand that we want to send this FRIDAY so we do not have a lot of time to make changes. When I have a final draft I will ask people to fax signatures or send originals to me by Friday.Thank you all for your help with this letter. We could not have done it with out you. We will be scheduling our next general meeting for mid October. Also  we have finalized the dates for the Annual Retreat and will be sending out packets with all the details next week. DJ and I are working on the agenda so if you have a specific topic you would like covered please let us know. As always  please send me an email or give me a call if you have any concerns or questions about the letter or any other matter. Thanks  Delaney  << File: ltr to governor -- options list.doc >>
jeffery.fawcett@enron.com,jeff.dasovich@enron.com,Jeff As I mentioned in my voice mail message  we met today with a group of customers in a workshop format to discuss the options filing  proposed amendment and tariff changes.  With the possible exception of one company (Amoco)  I thought the comments/feedback were mostly positive.  There seems to be two principal areas of concern with the proposed program:  (1) the possibility of affiliate abuse by ENA or EES  and (2) the potential of a party (ENA  or 3rd party) to exert market power.  Our position going into the workshop  and our most likely response going into the FERC proceeding  is that Transwestern doesn t want to be put into the position of being a "gatekeeper" for these issues  particularly with respect to market power.  In addition  we believe there are adequate protections under existing FERC policies (Order no. 497) regarding affiliate transactions.  We have a couple more personal meetings with the utilities in California (SoCal and PG&E) to complete prior to moving forward with the filing.  I m planning on going out to California the week of Sept. 11.  I d love to hook up with you while I m there.  I ll call you with specifics shortly.  If can answer any questions for you regarding the documents or the program itself  please give me a call at ext. 3-1521.
bhash1@earthlink.net,e201b-1@haas.berkeley.edu|e201b-2@haas.berkeley.edu,Hi everyone For this Saturday s section  I would like you guys to read (if youhaven t already) the article "Restructuring gives Japan s workersculture shock: Radical cuts by Nissan s French boss have wideimplications for Japan s jobs-for-life practices"from the 11/3 Fin. Times.Please think about how you might answer the following questions:1. Should the government extend unemployment benefits to the laid offworkers from Nissan?2. Why have Japanes companies paid younger workers less  and olderworkers more  Does this policy make sense?3. Should Nissan consider lowering the wages of some workers in order tolayoff fewer workers?I have attached a word 6.0 version of the article.  Also please notethat section is in C135.In addition I will try to discuss questions on Ghana  Ireland and Brazilthat Prof. Levine sent out.Also I have attached an article on asset prices and inflation targetting(from the FT) which discusses the dangers of "debt deflation". If wehave time I might discuss this as well.See you on Saturday.Bhash - asset prices.doc - Nissan.doc

Bill Cordes  Steve Harris  Shelley Corman  John Buchanan  Tony Pryor  and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present. 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format  we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale. 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined  and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year. 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option. 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether. 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance. 6.  Timeline:  - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)  - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service   - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)  - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron)  - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)  - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.

We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that the Nx3  we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the invoice for the next month s prepayment  so you need to keep a schedule and trueup each month for the prior months activity.

kate.symes@enron.com,jsymes@gladstone.uoregon.edu,My oh my - it s a rare occasion when I am greeted by such entertaining e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note  even if it was just a covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by the way  if I could do that  you can bet we would have already had rolling black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.Yes  I did finish the book. It was very interesting  although it did lose me for awhile in the middle. It s a super-fast read  so I m going to send another book along with it called "Liar s Poker." I just heard about it and it s supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall Street in the 1980s. I know  I know - Corporate America has taken its stranglehold on me  and pretty soon I ll be reading the stock market quotes for FUN! But just give it a chance; it s something a little different.No  Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get "Heartbreaking Work..." She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself later today  as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come to her senses and quit being evil.Anyway  I ve got to go control the world s electricity supply now. (This statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know  the one that comes after "One Meeeelllion Dollars....") But study up and make us all proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi  and study....or pay the price later.KateP.S. What the heck is your address anyway?

It doesn t really serve a purpose to have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to sort them out anyway.

I think he was looking at all deals in the system.  I almost think we should deal with this April  and worry about the rest when it comes up.   Will and I are also kicking around making the only choice in deal entry PPT.  Let Enpower sort out the rest.  We can modify stuff on the strip level  but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at the top of regular deal entry.How does that sound?c   Kate Symes                03/26/2001 10:55 AMTo: Cara Semperger/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: More deals found by Will Smith  I m unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at.

It s come to my attention - by virtue of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several people are interested in having access to those figures. I ve had requests from mid-marketing  trading  and scheduling  and am working with IT to put the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger  in particular  relies on the index prices in order to run one of her reports.I m wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your database  or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow Jones  and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the other. I don t have a preference either way - I m more than happy to compile the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you.

Both are expected to be confirmed to fill two vacancies on the five-member commission  which regulates interstate energy sales.Brownell is a member of the Pennsylvania Utility Commission. Wood is chair of the Texas Public Utility Commission and was appointed by President Bush when he was governor. Bush has opposed price caps  saying they discourage companies from building new power plants and would make the California situation worse.Two of the panel s current members -- the chair  Curt H?bert  a Republican  and Linda Breathitt  a Democrat -- oppose wholesale price caps. The third  Robert Massey  a Democrat  has supported the cost-of-service price caps California has sought  which would pay electricity providers the cost of producing the power plus a profit in the range of 11 to 15 percent.Looser limitsWith the backing of H?bert and Breathitt  the commission voted 2-1 last month to set a plan for looser limits on electricity prices in California during Stage 2 and Stage 3 emergencies. The state is considering whether to accept the plan  which some experts say could actually make the situation worse this summer.If Brownell and Wood supported the type of price caps California wants  they could join Massey to push it through the commission. But both told members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that they strongly support the free-market system for electricity instead of regulation such as price caps. And they said the complicated process of setting a specific cost-of-service price cap for each company could be a lengthy  bureaucratic process.A fair rate``Honestly  in the amount of time it would take to establish a fair rate  we might have enough power plants to negate the problem    Wood said.Brownell and Wood expressed concern about California s crisis and vowed to work quickly to help resolve the problems in prices for electricity and natural gas. They also said they would aggressively pursue inquiries into allegations of price gouging by electricity providers.``We need to end the uncertainty and the tragedy that is occurring for all the constituents of California and the West    Brownell said.Sen. Dianne Feinstein  D-Calif.  told Brownell and Wood that they were the two most important nominees to the Bush administration for California.``You can make the difference between life and death    she said. ``California effectively stands at a precipice.  No explanationFeinstein questioned the two about the huge price increases in electricity and natural gas in California  but Brownell and Wood said that without detailed information they could not explain the increases. But they admitted that the large increases raise concerns.``The math doesn t add up    Wood said when questioned as to why natural gas in California has cost more than three times what it costs across the state s border.Despite their hesitancy on setting price caps  Feinstein said she was optimistic that they might be helpful to her press for the limits. She met with both for about an hour privately last month. Although Senate rules prevent asking questions about specific policy positions  Feinstein said Brownell and Wood showed flexibility and an understanding of the complicated California situation.

"Afterward  we would just sit there and watch the market change." Power juggling ramped up price Insiders say manipulation also strained equipment Christian Berthelsen  Scott Winokur  Chronicle Staff Writers <mailto:cberthelsen@sfchronicle.com>Sunday  May 20  2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/20/MN121438.DTL>Large power companies have driven up electricity prices in California by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages  according to dozens of interviews with regulators  lawyers and energy industry workers. Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14 990 megawatts of generating capacity  nearly a third of the state s total  was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns  more than four times as much as a year ago. Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand  the warm spring and summer months of May to September  when electricity usage normally grows by a third. Loretta Lynch  president of the California Public Utilities Commission  said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator  which manages the state s power grid  says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply. But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these "gaming" tactics contributed to the plants  deteriorating condition. "We suspected it " said Jim MacIntosh  the manager of grid operations for the ISO. "It was a sure factor in driving up prices." Such swings in unit output  he said  "would only make sense in a scenario when they re trying to game something. Otherwise  why would they do that? They re tearing their units up." Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company s headquarters in Houston. According to the accounts of three plant operators  Reliant s operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease  then increase output at the 1 046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell  plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up. "They would tell us what to do  and we would do it " said one of the men  who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired. "Afterward  we would just sit there and watch the market change." The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the state s power crisis began in earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. "It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston  rather than the reliability needs of the ISO " said Carl Wood  a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agency s investigation into plant outages. "Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability  they re responsive to demands for profitability." Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market. They and other power companies  including AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc.  have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging  decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California s needs. While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every 10 minutes  company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. "As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design  we are required to do that " said Kevin Frankeny  an operations official with Reliant. "When the ISO (issues dispatch orders)  they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within an hour." Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first. The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility  but Stephanie McCorkle  an ISO spokeswoman  said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers. "ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that " said one of the operators. "Not for an individual unit." Officials with the California attorney general s office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice  citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping  if proved to have been done to drive up prices  could violate the state s unfair business practices laws. Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators. When power companies bid on hourly contracts  they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot price  they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required. The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement  which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. Then  he said  it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again  the output was back at the expected level. Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if the price reached a satisfactory level  generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times  if the price was low  output was brought down and kept down. The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston  with some being more aggressive than others. "What they would do  especially late at night  is if the price tanked  they would undergenerate " an operator said. "Then  mysteriously  the price would go up. "Then  if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output)  they d say   Go up to 90.  That would cause the price to tank. And they d say   Bring it down again.  " Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 minutes  the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like 80 minutes  to avoid stressing the machinery  one of the workers said. Moreover  they were typically run at constant levels  which also reduced wear and tear. "They were basically ramping up as fast as they can  and then slamming the brakes on " said one of the operators. "They were increasing the fatigue on the units." ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics  including instituting a so-called 10-minute market  rather than the hourly market  so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power. But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices. A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies. Plants owned by Reliant  AES  Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for more than half of the state s unplanned shutdowns  even though their generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state s total capacity from all sources. Reliant  one of California s largest and most profitable out-of-state generators  reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310)  AES Corp. of Arlington  Va. (278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte  N.C. (261). Reliant s unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53 000 megawatts over the 40-day period  an average of 1 368 per day - enough power for 1.4 million homes for one hour. Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard  with one generating unit down for 26 days  accounted for more than 30 000 of those missed megawatts. However  an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures. Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair. They are old: At 48  Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant s five California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at Etiwanda  a tube leak  had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management  they said  but it had not deteriorated much  it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem. Moreover  at the time of the shutdown  the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online  the operators said. Richard Wheatley  a spokesman for Reliant  denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance. Ramping may be rampant Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES  Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there  although less frequently. The scheduling calls came from Dynegy s trading floor in Houston  rather than NRG in Minneapolis  he said. Steve Stengel  a spokesman for Dynegy  said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day  and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. In a May 2000 report  the California Energy Commission cited Reliant s Etiwanda plant  as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants  as some of the "major beneficiaries of high real-time prices" that spring. One way to obtain those high prices  the plant workers said  was the simple method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met. On one occasion  one operator said  Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1 000 per megawatt hour  even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. "The operator said   It s our unit  shut it off   " the source said.

The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK. EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli s facilities.Bob Manasse  Vice President Origination of EES Europe  said: "Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia."German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who  in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier  BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary)  succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August. Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany. However  the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB s territory  which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the "heart land" of Germany. Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight LocomotiveOn Saturday  1st September  a ten-strong delegation from Enron s coal team traveled up to British Energy s Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive  recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist  Freightliner Heavy Haul.   Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000  effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.  True to form  the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.Stuart Staley  Enron s international coal group vice-president  praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron. While Eddie Fitzsimons  managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:   We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17 000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal  almost all of that for Enron. The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  "The new locomotive was named Don Raider  after the river Don  a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located " explains Tom Kearney  a director in Enron s international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.  "Other "Raider Class" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date  each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports."  While mischievous Enron employees may think the name sounds suspiciously like a covert activity carried out by the new market entrants  we can assure you that would simply be speculation!   Congratulations again to the Coal team on securing this landmark deal.Enron Credit StatisticsPlease find following the latest figures for Enron Credit as of September 5  2001:* Total Year to Date Transactions >  550* Year to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $9.82 billion* Total Life to Date Registered Users >  over 7 000 non-Enron users and 790 Enron users  - 9% of non-Enron registered users visit www.enroncredit.com more than once per week  - over 2 500 registered users log in to the Enron Credit website each month* Enron Cost of Credit (ECC) > over 22 000 readers per week view the ECC in independent publicationsWe are looking for great ideas for the EnTouch and the Brown Bag Lunch Series.

I hope you don t mind.  I m tired from moving.  Enron s moved me in the past and I m used to just pointing and saying "that will go over there"  etc.  and i spent all sunday night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good.  i don t think you ve ever seen my loft  but to get to it  you have to take the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this  I think they almost quit!  it was bad  but they did a great job.  I told one of them  "the building i m moving into will be a breeze compared to this one" and he laughed and said "of course  you have the worst apartment i ve ever moved".  poor guy.  that s the most entertaining tidbit i could come up with.  you should meet the building manager in our new building.  he s a freak  but in a professional way.  he s already yelled at jai and i.  he sounds russian and says in a thick accent "if you vant to leeve here  you haf to obey da rrrulesss".  i hope you read that with a russian accent in your head.  he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen!  his wife is a piece of work as well.  count me in for the wine fest.  if you pick up some tix  grab me one  or let me know where the website is  etc.    i can t believe you ve moved on from tubulars.  while tubulars does seem like the next big thing  oil and gas seems like a promising area to study.   - c -

In terms of forward curve  Entergy is the worst place to be long assets right now.

I spoke with a guy at Entergy in their merchant plant development group.  They have a site in Louisiana in advanced development (all permits  interconnection  water  etc) including a steam offtake agreement with an industrial host (2x1 combined cycle  7FA turbines  approx. 550 MW).  They were scheduled to begin construction in the next few weeks.  Given the state of the market  Entergy management has pulled the plug on this project and they are looking to sell everything (permitted site  turbines  steam contract).  He wouldn t tell me where the plant was located in Louisiana except that it was on Entergy s system.  Looking through the development book  it looks like it could be the Lake Charles plant with PPG as steam host?  Given the steam sale  the effective heat rate he quoted was 6700 HHV (new and clean).I know we aren t in the market for assets right now  but I wanted to pass on the information.  I ve given this info to Carson and Jacoby as well.Regards Heather

In Houston  the segment is scheduled to run tonight  April 29 at 6:30 p.m. CST on KUHF 88.7 FM.  Employees outside of Houston should check their local NPR listing for Marketplace air times.  The segment also will be available later today on NPR s website: www.npr.org.

Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. JonPS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

thomas.a.martin@enron.com,bryan.hull@enron.com,Bryan Yes  I would like to talk to you.  I think it will make sense to have an analyst in some capacity.  I didn t realize that you would making this decision so soon.  Maybe we can talk after bidweek (early next week).  If that timing does not work let me know.  I am still not sure if or when Lavorato is going to give me a Trading Track analyst/associate.  But I still would like to talk to you before you make a decision.Tom -----Original Message-----From:  Hull  Bryan  Sent: Monday  April 23  2001 4:33 PMTo: Martin  Thomas A.Subject: RotationTom I wanted to let you know that I have started interviewing for my next rotation.

I am very interested in the possibility of working on the Texas Desk.Thanks Bryan Hull3-9195

I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens  someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule:Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed  the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.  If that happens to be midnight  sorry.  That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.  Sorry I have to be a jerk  but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.

enron.announcements@enron.com,all.america@enron.com,Car Rental Options for Enron TravelersRental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron s total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).National Car Rental  due to its service levels  availability and total value proposition  has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers  needs.Alamo Rent-A-Car  a sister company to National  has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status  due to its service levels  availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National  where available.When you rent a vehicle in the United States  (including Puerto Rico) or Canada  the following insurance provisions are included  regardless of rate selected: 1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 2.

For both National and Alamo  the coverage is $100 000 per person  $300 000 per occurrence and $50 000 for property damage. ** IMPORTANT ***These coverages apply regardless of rate selected  as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron s preferred suppliers  it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National s and Alamo s preferred traveler programs.

Sources close to the Houston company say it s considering deals with other energy-trading companies  private-equity firms  and blue-chip saviors such as GE Capital. The Wall Street Journal and CNBC reported that Dynegy is in merger talks with Enron. The company s financial crisis was sparked by disclosures about some of its off-balance-sheet partnership deals negotiated by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. A Securities & Exchange Commission investigation and the threat of liabilities from shareholder lawsuits could make it tough for Enron to land a new investor.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Finance & EconomicsSee you in court11/17/2001The EconomistCopyright (C) 2001 The Economist; Source: World Reporter (TM) - FT McCarthyThe company s trials have just begun LAWYERS are swarming all over Enron s old financial statements and press releases in the hope of reaping huge fees from securities litigation. More than 20 class-action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks  and new ones are popping up every day. A formal process has been started to consolidate litigation in Houston  where the troubled energy company is based  with all lawyers interested in the case required to stake their claims by December 21st.The broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement  legal ways of saying that the company s financial statements were garbage. This week  Enron s founder and chairman  Kenneth Lay  decided to forgo a severance package worth over $60m while admitting that the company s problems "had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital  both on and off the balance sheet". America s Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is looking again at off-balance-sheet financing  having fretted about it on and off for a decade. There will also be charges of insider trading  because even as Enron was issuing securities amid glowing profits reports  top executives were dumping over $1 billion of Enron shares to "unsuspecting investors"  a group that includes anybody who  however briefly  has held one of the company s 750m shares in the past two years. "The number of class members will be huge " says Maurice Pesso  a lawyer at a New York firm that has filed a claim. There are  however  limits to the company s liability. It has already restated its results going back five years  but federal law restricts litigation to the past three. Moreover  Enron will not take the rap alone. Its auditor  Arthur Andersen (now plain Andersen)  is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed. The litigation comes after a rough decade for Andersen. It has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as Waste Management  Sunbeam and Discovery Zone. Because Enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm  it became much like an unregulated bank. The lack of supervision meant that the role of the company s auditor was crucial. Andersen was certainly paid as if it was. In 2000  it collected $25m for auditing Enron s books and another $27m for consulting services. Now how do you account for that?Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Business/Financial Desk; Section CDid Ken Lay Understand What Was Happening at Enron?By FLOYD NORRIS11/16/2001The New York TimesPage 1  Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyWHAT a tangled web was weaved by Enron. Both investors and managers seem to have been misled.   Enron became overleveraged    Kenneth L. Lay  Enron s chairman and chief executive  said this week  adding that things went wrong in ways that   I could not have ever contemplated.   He pointed to investments that   performed far worse than we ever could have imagined.  That was the first time that Enron had admitted it had a leverage problem  and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others. Mr. Lay says he understood what was going on  but I suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by Enron s soothing financial statements. When Enron was riding high  it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants. Mr. Lay and other executives sold stock  but the company did not. Just a month ago  Mr. Lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company s continuing earnings were. The leverage was not easy to find. A lot of it was carried off Enron s balance sheet. Partnerships and special-purpose entities that Enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to Enron. Enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock. As undisclosed losses built up in those entities  it became more likely they could not pay their bills  leaving Enron to do so. It is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand Enron s plight until the last couple of weeks. When they figured it out  it took a $1.5 billion equity infusion that is part of the Dynegy takeover to keep Enron s rating above junk level. Now Enron has a board committee investigating various transactions  and promises to release details as they are uncovered. Officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time  and perhaps they are. Jeffrey Skilling  Mr. Lay s protege  was Enron s chief financial engineer until he quit this summer. And Enron s chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as Enron unraveled. Some investors would say none of that matters now  that the only important fact is that Dynegy is buying Enron anyway. Chuck Watson  Dynegy s chief executive  is convinced that Enron s energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price Dynegy is paying. He figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained. The big question now may be whether Mr. Watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study Enron s trading positions. Enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions -- positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet -- but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies. If big surprises are found  Dynegy could back out of the deal. There is plenty of blame to go around here  and suits have been filed against Enron  its current and former officials  and its auditor  Arthur Andersen. But investors also bear responsibility. Enron s financial statements were  as Mr. Lay conceded this week    opaque and difficult to understand.   Investors and analysts knew they did not know what was going on. They bought anyway. Enron was viewed as a company that always made its numbers. An old-line gas pipeline company had been transformed into a brilliant trader that could apply its magic around the world. Investors did not care how Enron made the numbers. Now  when it is too late  they do.Graph tracks the monthly closes of Enron s stock price from 1998 through 2001.

National Desk; Section AA Quick Change in Fortune Dulls the Glimmer of HoustonBy JIM YARDLEY11/16/2001The New York TimesPage 14  Column 1c. 2001 New York Times CompanyHOUSTON  Nov. 15 -- On a day when oil prices plunged to two-year lows  when the hometown Enron Corporation continued its ugly free fall and when gloomy projections showed the local economy headed for a decidedly rough patch  George Alcorn lunched on Chilean sea bass at the downtown Petroleum Club and decided that the sky was not falling.   I ve been an optimist all my life    said Mr. Alcorn  69  who owns an independent exploration company and survived the oil bust years of the mid-1980 s.   The opportunities in this town have always been large. I don t think it s going to change at all.  That Mr. Alcorn could sound upbeat in such seemingly grim economic times is hardly surprising in a city largely built on pluck and buoyant optimism. Until recently  economists had predicted that the economic downturn plaguing the rest of the nation would largely bypass Houston  the nation s energy capital. In June  The Economist magazine  citing Houston s increasingly diverse economy  even promoted it as a candidate for the world s next great international city and business center. But June is a long time ago. By then  the city had already lost 2 000 jobs from the struggling computer maker Compaq and will probably now lose thousands more if the company s merger with Hewlett-Packard is approved. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks  Continental Airlines  which is based here  announced 12 000 layoffs  some likely to come in Houston. The Texas Medical Center  one of the largest medical complexes in the world  is facing financial peril after flooding in June caused an estimated $2 billion in damages. The latest blow to the economy as well as the local psyche is the plight of Enron  the energy company that some analysts said tottered near bankruptcy before a merger with its local rival  Dynegy  was announced last week. Even if the merger goes through  the city is expected to feel a crunch; local real estate analysts say the merger could produce a glut of downtown office space at a time when new towers are under construction  including one by Enron. One visible symbol of the changing fortunes is that two of the city s sports stadiums  Enron Field and Compaq Center  are named for companies that soon may not exist. This week  the National Association of Purchasing Management  which measures business activity and industrial production  released a report showing that Houston s economy had contracted in October after 32 consecutive months of expansion.   Over the first half of this year  you had to feel pretty good    said Bill Gilmer  an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and an authority on Houston. But Mr. Gilmer said that much of the city s recent job growth was driven by oil and gas companies and that the decline in prices meant the sector was   running out of steam.     The national economy    Mr. Gilmer added    is not helping out right now.   The fact that the ailing national economy is dragging on Houston is  oddly enough  evidence of the city s success in recovering from the 1980 s oil bust. Then  with the local economy dominated by oil and gas  the drop in prices crushed the city and prompted civic leaders to preach economic diversification. And it worked: Compaq  Continental  the Texas Medical Center as well as dramatic growth in small business helped Houston recover and grow even faster  becoming the nation s fourth-largest city. The new generation of sophisticated energy companies  led by Enron  then created a boom. Economists say the next several months are likely to be slow. There could be substantial layoffs if Compaq and Enron mergers take place. Mr. Gilmer said the price of oil still played a large role in the city s economy; the number of exploration rigs has dropped to roughly 1 000 from about 1 300 in recent months. Yet no one is predicting a reprise of the bust  when downtown office buildings stood practically empty. Instead  economists point to a relatively quick rebound. Ray Perryman  a Texas economist who runs the Perryman Group  said Houston still had an infrastructure envied by most other cities  including the city s bustling port  the nation s second largest. The city was recently named as one of four finalists to become the American entry to be host of the 2012 Olympic Games. Voters recently approved construction of a starter light rail line  and federal environmental officials recently signed off on a plan to greatly reduce air pollution.   We re sitting here with over two million jobs    said former Mayor Bob Lanier. The downfall of Enron  though  a company whose value dropped almost 90 percent because of accounting problems and financial distress  has been the most highly publicized and unexpected blow to the city s economy. The company had embodied the self-image that Houston business leaders hold dear: it was entrepreneurial  aggressive and ground breaking. It was also a generous civic benefactor; the company s chairman  Kenneth L. Lay  a close friend of President Bush  had even been rumored as a potential mayoral candidate. But this week  Enron s lost glory became painfully evident. In a hall at Rice University on Tuesday  Mr. Lay presented Alan Greenspan  the Federal Reserve chairman  with a lifetime achievement award  the Enron Prize  which Mr. Lay s company had endowed and named in flush times. The next morning  an article in The Houston Chronicle said no decision had been made on whether the name of the prize would be changed.Photos: Compaq Center  home of the N.B.A. Houston Rockets  is named for a company that soon may not exist.

Sports Desk; Section SSPORTS BUSINESSJohnson and Longley Hurting Bottom LineBy Richard Sandomir11/16/2001The New York TimesPage 3  Column 5c. 2001 New York Times CompanyLarry Johnson and Luc Longley are gone from the Knicks  roster  but clearly not forgotten by their former employers at Cablevision. There will be no corporate tributes to Johnson  who retired  and Longley  who was waived. There will be no statues erected in their honor outside Madison Square Garden  a division of Cablevision.But Johnson and Longley live on in Cablevision s third-quarter financial report  even though their names go unmentioned. The Garden has paid them the $48 million they had remaining on their contracts  then wrote them off because they are no longer performing for their money; the players lost the value they had when they first arrived at the Garden. Now they are nonperforming assets  not a small power forward and a bulky 7-foot-2-inch center. At least Johnson was  for a time after his acquisition in 1996  a key part of the team  even if his bad back kept him from scoring or rebounding as he had with the Charlotte Hornets. But the injured Longley s contribution last season was minuscule. So the Garden  which was hurt by fewer shows at the Garden and Radio City Music Hall  took a one-time hit and wrote off the value of Johnson s and Longley s contracts. For the third quarter  which ended Sept. 30  the Garden s operating cash-flow deficit was $32.4 million  compared with $29.6 million in operating cash flow last year for the same period. (Operating cash flow at Cablevision is defined as operating profit before depreciation and amortization.) Insurance will cover some of the cost of the Johnson-Longley payouts.   The team looks healthy    Jim Dolan  the president of Cablevision  said on Tuesday during a conference call with analysts.   I don t expect any more write-offs.   Whether that turns out to be true depends on whether any currently hearty player sustains a career-ending injury. But Cablevision could have avoided this financial circumstance had it paid attention to the physical conditions of Johnson and Longley. In each case  the Garden knew it was acquiring damaged goods. In his second season in Charlotte  Johnson hurt his back  and he has never been the same. Maybe the Garden was swayed that he was well enough  because he averaged 20.5 points and 8.4 rebounds in the season before it traded Anthony Mason for him. But the persistence of his back problems in the last few seasons attests to the riskiness of getting him in the first place. The back compromised his skills  often limiting him to being a symbol of the Knicks  grit. He also spelled   L   with his bended arm quite nicely  yet not worth an average of $7 million a year. When Longley arrived from Phoenix last year in the four-team deal that sent Patrick Ewing to Seattle  he said he had told the Knicks that he had a degenerative ankle condition.   I brought up my ankle in my physical with the Knicks    he said in July    and they said   Have you been playing?  I said   Yes   and that was it.   The fact was  he played for the Australian Olympic team in Sydney last year  but pain from his ankle kept him from practicing. Should have been a tip-off. The Naming Rights Dance Enron Field  home of the Houston home run  is bound to be called something different next season when Jimy Williams starts his tenure as the Astros  manager. Enron  the world s largest energy trader  agreed to pay $100 million to put its name on the ballpark for 30 years  a deal that began last year. But Enron is in trouble. It has lost nearly $60 billion in its market value; the company recently said it had overstated its profits for the past five years by nearly $600 million and it agreed to be acquired by Dynergy for $9 billion. In another part of Houston  the Compaq Center could take on another name now that the computer maker it was named for in 1997 (at $900 000 annually for six years) is planning to merge with Hewlett-Packard. In 2003  the Rockets will move to a new arena. Named stadiums and arenas have changed monikers before. A takeover turned Philadelphia s Comcast Center into the First Union Center. The TWA Dome in St. Louis is now the Dome at America s Center to reflect TWA s purchase by American Airlines. Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo now has HSBC s name. Meanwhile  Pro Player Stadium near Miami is named for a defunct division of the bankrupt Fruit of the Loom. Two other N.F.L. stadiums  one being built  the other three years old  are named for ailing companies. In Foxboro  Mass.  CMGI Field is being readied for play next season by the New England Patriots. In the 12 months ended July 31  CMGI  an Internet development company  lost $4.4 billion (twice the annual network TV payments to the N.F.L.). CMGI will pay $114 million over 15 years for its naming deal -- if it lasts that long. PSInet  an Internet communications services provider that is paying $105.5 million over 20 years to be the name atop the Baltimore Ravens  stadium  filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this year after losing $3.2 billion in the quarter ending March 31. The Conseco Fieldhouse in Indiana  the home of the Pacers  is named for a finance and insurance company that recently posted a $410 million quarterly loss. The financial state of some airlines since Sept. 11 may affect some of the arenas and stadiums named for them. Besides the dome in St. Louis  six other facilities are named for airlines (two for American). Last year  the Canadian Airlines Saddledome  where the Calgary Flames play  changed its name when its namesake went bankrupt and was bought by Air Canada. Now it is the Pengrowth Saddledome.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This WeekBy K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>Staff ReporterTheStreet.com11/16/2001 07:22 AM ESTURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10004082.html>1. Fund Companies Gouge InvestorsMore gouging for clueless investors: Yet another fund company has said it will tack a sales charge onto its mutual funds. In December  Credit Suisse Warburg Pincus Funds will start selling its funds through brokers in a bid to attract more assets. The decision fits into a lamentable trend among fund companies adding sales charges to funds that previously had been sold directly. Others who ve done it include Scudder  Strong and Invesco. Sure  it s no surprise that fund marketers are out to rack up more sales  and working through brokers is an easy way to do that (especially for funds with lousy reputations  which are less likely to attract direct investments without outside intervention). But that doesn t change the fact that load funds are almost always a rotten deal for investors. Legally  funds with loads are allowed to charge up to 8.5% of the initial investment in sales fees. In effect  paying a load reduces the size of an initial investment. When you consider the effects of compounding  that lost money could add up to a whopping amount in foregone returns over time. And now more than ever  investors can t afford to give up one iota of potential yields. 2. Cipro Is No Savior for BayerA coda to the Cipro investment story  which we argued earlier was unconvincing: Sure enough  a recent earnings report from Bayer (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - news - commentary)   the German chemical conglomerate that produces Cipro  shows that the company s other operational screwups more than outweighed the small gains it received from sales of the anti-anthrax drug. For its latest quarter  Bayer reported a loss of 183 million euros  compared with a profit of 534 million euros a year ago. The company acknowledged "substantial" extra business from Cipro shipments  including the U.S. government s order of 100 million tablets. But it said the additional sales were "nowhere near enough to compensate" for difficulties in other pharmaceutical lines  notably the damaging withdrawal of its cholesterol-lowering drug Lipobay/Baycal from the market in August after it was implicated in a number of deaths. Bayer s stock  which had dropped in the wake of the terrorist attacks  rose sharply as anthrax cases hit the news. From its low point on Sept. 21  the stock jumped 37.3% to its peak on Oct. 12. Since then  with anthrax fears abating and the news of disappointing earnings  the stock has lost 8.3%. 3. Ken Lay  Playing It by the Book You almost have to admire the gall of Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) CEO Kenneth Lay  who  in exchange for presiding over the company s brisk slide into mayhem  tried to slip out the door with a $60.6 million pay package. He backed off that plan  according to press reports  on news that Enron employees were apoplectic about the deal. Some of them may lose their jobs in the merger with Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary)   which came about after Enron s stock cratered on revelations about its fly-by-night accounting practices. To be sure  Lay s employment agreement had provided for the payout if he left the company within 60 days of a change in control. We can only assume that at the time it was drawn up  the agreement s authors didn t see the need to mention that he should leave the company in one piece. By the way  lest we convey the impression that Lay has acted cavalierly  he says he s put on his thinking cap lately. "As might be expected  this is a very reflective time for me " he said on a merger-related conference call this week. We re a little skeptical of that claim  given that he said in the same call  "We don t have anything to hide. Quite to the contrary  I think we ve been very forthcoming." Enron is currently under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission; fleeing investors have bid the stock down about 90% from its high last fall. 4. A Blodget Blunder?Speaking of folks who lost money for investors  analyst Henry Blodget is taking part in a buyout at Merrill Lynch  reportedly exiting the firm with a severance package of about $2 million. (Bwah-ha-ha-ha-ha.) Blodget won notoriety for talking up the prospects of many Internet issues that later went belly-up or were acquired on the cheap  including such resounding losers as Pets.com  PSINet and uBid. Last summer one irate investor  claiming he d lost half a million dollars by taking Blodget s advice  extracted $400 000 in compensation from Merrill Lynch. But despite the lousy stock calls  in retrospect Blodget looks pretty smart. He cultivated a momentarily outsized (if short-lived) cult of personality -- worth doing once during a lifetime  in our humble opinion -- and secured a tidy payout on the way out the door. We note his exit from the scene not because he was dumb  but because his passage represents the end of an ignominiously silly era -- one in which ordinary investors tossed money into dubious ideas (like Pets.com)  then were ungraceful enough to complain they d gotten bad advice. There s no question analysts may have meted out absurdly bullish stock forecasts. The bigger problem is that investors  suckered by the potential of outlandish profits  acted like they believed them. 5. Unflagging American OpportunistsWhile we salute the unflagging American entrepreneurial spirit  we note that it also can metamorphose into enthusiastic fraud. Such was the case with three opportunists flagged by the SEC this week: companies claiming to have products that protect against bioterrorism. Most inventive of the three was from R-Tec Technologies (RTTC.OB:OTC BB - news - commentary)   which claimed to have developed a "Chemical and Biological Alarm and Neutralization Defense system " or in trumped-up military lingo  "C-BAND." The company said it s the first "mechanically-operated" (with a wind-up key in back?) system to protect citizens from such attacks. R-Tec has admitted that it s never tested the device  doesn t have any plans to manufacture it and doesn t actually hold a patent on it. But it gets bonus fraud points for the cool acronym. More straightforward scams were from Disease Sciences (DISE.OB:OTC BB - news - commentary) and The Classica Group (TCGI:Nasdaq SC - news - commentary)   which said they had technology capable of killing anthrax in the mail. Disease Science touted its "High Pressure Pulse" processing  a fairly intensive-sounding application that  the SEC notes  it does not have a license to use. The Classica Group s alleged microwave technology likewise got a thumbs-down from the SEC. GLOBAL INVESTING - Fidelity reveals a rise in its Enron exposure.By ELIZABETH WINE.11/16/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedFidelity  the world s largest mutual fund company  boosted its exposure to troubled energy trader Enron by about 20 per cent in the third quarter  just as the stock began to collapse amid regulatory scrutiny. In filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission released this week  the Boston-based company reported that it owned 20.8m shares of Enron on September 30 - up from 16.5m on June 30. The group reports its holdings with a two-month delay.The filings do not detail the holdings of individual funds. The group s managers could also have sold some of their holdings since the filing period ended. Morningstar analyst Scott Cooley noted that even after the increase  assuming no shares had been sold  Fidelity would own about 3 per cent of Enron s outstanding shares  a small amount for such a large fund manager. With more than $800bn under management  the group holds sizeable positions in many companies. Mr Cooley said the increase was characteristic of Fidelity "buying on the dip". Enron shares began falling in September  as news emerged that the company s financial statements were more complex than investors realised  featuring several off-balance sheet partnerships  now under SEC investigation. Enron s shares plunged nearly 66 per cent in the fourth quarter. (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. http://www.ft.com.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc.

All Rights ReservedFRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - HP and Compaq chiefs to forego $22m - Revelation comes amid shareholder concern over $24bn acquisition. The chief executives of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer will forego more than $22m in retention bonuses to which they would be entitled if the agreed merger of their two companies goes ahead.The revelation  contained in a regulatory filing on Thursday  comes amid widespread shareholder concern about HP s planned acquisition of Compaq for about $24bn. The sons of HP s two co-founders have criticised the deal  raising doubts that shareholders would back HP s takeover of its rival. Their opposition has prompted speculation that Carly Fiorina  HP s chief executive  would be forced out if the deal was voted down. She would have been entitled to receive retention bonuses totalling $8m  equal to double the sum of her current salary and target annual bonus. But she has declined to accept the right to participate in this programme. Michael Capellas  her counterpart at Compaq  was eligible to receive retention bonuses totaling $14.4m  equivalent to three times the sum of his current base salary and target annual bonus. Their decisions are shown in a so-called S-4 formal merger prospectus prepared by HP and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing outlines the managements  arguments for the merger. Despite Ms Fiorina s decision  HP has agreed to a retention payment programme for key executives that could total about $33m if all of them remain employed until payment of the second installment of their retention bonuses. In addition  Ms Fiorina and several other officials are negotiating new contracts that would give them higher salaries  the potential for bonuses and stock options. The compensation plan could cost as much as $22.4m if all key figures remain with the merged company for a certain period of time. The decision by Ms Fiorina and Mr Capellas comes after Ken Lay  chairman and chief executive of Enron  was prompted by shareholder outcry to announce he would not take the more than $60m he was entitled to after Enron agreed a rescue bid by rival energy group Dynegy. The S-4 noted that Walter Hewlett  the lone HP director who has opposed the combination  is a member of HP s compensation committee. Meanwhile  the US Federal Trade Commission has asked Hewlett-Packard and Compaq to provide them with additional information and other material concerning their proposed merger. While it is a standard regulatory practice  the companies warned that the request under federal law would in effect extend the waiting period for completion of the merger until August 30 next year. The S-4 did not provide a date for the shareholder votes required to consummate the $24bn deal. HP on Wednesday surprised the market by posting fiscal fourth quarter results that far exceeded analysts  expectations. (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.PORTLAND  Ore. (AP) - Employees of Portland General Electric are in shock after watching their retirement savings dry up along with the stock of energy giant Enron  PGE s parent company. The sting isn t helped by the fact that the selloff coincided with a lockdown that forced employees to hold the stock in their 401(k) retirement plans.Stock prices have plummeted more than 70 percent since Oct. 16  when Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss. The loss stemmed largely from investment write-offs that led to the dismissal of the company s chief financial officer and now are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Oct. 17  Houston-based Enron "locked down" the 401(k) accounts  meaning employees were not allowed to sell their Enron stock or make any other changes to their plans. The freeze lasted until Wednesday. Peggy Fowler  PGE chief executive officer  said the lockdown was the result of a long-planned change in retirement fund managers and acknowledged that "the timing couldn t have been worse." For 2 700 PGE employees with Enron 401(k) plans  the slump has decimated their nest eggs. "We couldn t get out  we just sat there and watched our nest eggs go down to nothing " said Roy Rinard  a PGE lineman from Boring with all of his 401(k) plan in Enron stock. Rinard  54  said his account has dropped in value from more than $472 000 a year ago to $238 000 at the time of the freeze to about $70 000 now. "I just feel like I ve been stolen from and lied to " said Alan Kaseweter  43  a PGE service department employee who had almost all of his 401(k) invested in Enron stock. Kaseweter  of Redlands  said his account has dwindled from $348 000 a year ago to $115 500 at the time of the freeze to $36 000. Enron and PGE employees must accept Enron stock as the company s matching contribution to their 401(k) accounts. Only employees over 50 and retirees are allowed to roll it over to another investment. Enron seemed like a good bet. The stock climbed 475 percent between 1995 and Dec. 31  2000. Enron purchased PGE in 1997  while it was reinventing itself into a cutting-edge energy trading company. It took staple products such as natural gas and electricity and attempted to trade them like other commodities. Reports surfaced about partnerships founded by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. The partnerships borrowed money on Enron s behalf  which allowed Enron to keep the debt off its books. Fastow left the company  and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation. On Nov. 8  Enron said it was restating earnings for the past five years  in effect admitting that it had inflated profits. At the same time  Enron froze employees  401(k) accounts. Enron decided in July that it would hire new administrators for the retirement program. The changeover required about a month. Enron directors and executives dumped stock through much of the past 12 months  selling more than $136 million worth in all - a fact prominently mentioned in recent shareholder lawsuits against the company. Investors have also filed five lawsuits against Enron s executives and directors  including former PGE chief executive Kenneth L. Harrison.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc.

India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week11/16/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001  Dow Jones & Company  Inc.)NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Prospective buyers of the 85% foreign equity in India s 2 184-megawatt Dabhol Power Co. will start due diligence of the project next week  A.K. Doda  executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB)  told Dow Jones Newswires Friday. The possible buyers are Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX)"After the due diligence is completed  price negotiations will start and thereafter  the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place " Doda said. U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant s sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government s failure to honor payment guarantees. In August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. Dabhol is India s largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%  while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in DPC. "The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties  through mutual negotiations. Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest " Doda said. Doda denied local media reports saying that India s state-owned firm National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol. "So far  I am aware of only two companies - Tata Power and BSES. NTPC haven t sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project " he said. -By Himendra Kumar; Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9426; himendra.kumar@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc.

Report on Business: CanadianU.S. firms get in on Alaska pipelineLILY NGUYEN11/16/2001The Globe and MailMetroB1"All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors. All rights reserved."CALGARY -- Six powerhouse U.S. players are joining TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Westcoast Energy Inc. in an attempt to inject new momentum into a bid to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline from Alaska. The partnership  which includes energy services and transportation giants Williams Cos.  Duke Energy Corp.  Enron Corp.  as well as major utilities El Paso Corp.  PG&E Corp. and Sempra Energy Utilities Ventures have agreed to work together with TransCanada and Westcoast to put a proposal before the Alaska gas producers before the end of the year. The group  which laid out its intentions in a memorandum of understanding signed yesterday  said they believe a gas pipeline running along the Alaska Highway can be built by 2008.Murray Birch  senior vice-president of Westcoast  said the partners lend expertise  deep pockets and scale to the mammoth project  which is estimated to cost well over $10-billion (U.S.). "It s in our best interest to involve them. This project is a large project  and certainly Westcoast and TransCanada would have been stretched to do it by ourselves " said Mr. Birch  who is also the co-chief executive officer of Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. a joint venture co-owned by Westcoast and TransCanada. Foothills holds the regulatory permits to the proposed Alaska Highway pipeline. Mr. Birch said the equity position of each company in the project is still to be worked out. Rocco Cianco  a Foothills spokesman  said that is in part because some of the companies are in a state of flux. Westcoast is in the process of being taken over by Duke  while Houston-based Enron is in the process of being bought by hometown rival Dynegy Corp. The partnership brings back to the table all nine of the original participants in a similar pipeline project that was proposed in the 1970s and shelved because of weakening commodity prices and native opposition. Mr. Birch noted that it also removes a legal question hanging over the pipeline project  of whether the six U.S. companies had any claim on the project based on their capital investment in the 1970s project. They withdrew from that project on the understanding that if it was to restart  they would be able to recover that initial investment  which some have pegged at up to $4-billion including interest  he said. In getting back on board  the six companies have agreed to waive that claim  he said. Scott Kent  the Minister of Economic Development for Yukon  a vocal proponent of the proposed pipeline  said the removal of the legal question lifts a huge barrier to the project. "There was a chance this could have ended up in a lengthy court battle that would have significantly hampered" the project  he said. "It s certainly very good news." Winfried Fruehauf  an analyst at National Bank Financial in Toronto  said the six U.S. companies as well as Westcoast  TransCanada and Foothills are trying to make sure they re first in line to move the gas from burgeoning Alaskan fields to market. "Everybody and his and her uncle wants to be in this pipeline  there s so many  me toos  that they just want to position themselves " he said. The market understanding is that the Alaska producers  which include Exxon Mobil Corp.  Phillips Petroleum Co.  BP Amoco PLC and Chevron Corp.  will ultimately decide who will build and operate a pipeline because the cost of such a project would be recovered from them in the form of pipeline tolls. Gina Taylor  a spokeswoman for Enron  said the partners got together with an eye on approaching producers to get an answer from them on whether the project can go ahead. "Marketplace approval is key to us moving forward with this " she said. "That s why we put the [memorandum] in place  so we could go out and revisit with the producers." But Curtis Thayer  a spokesman for the Alaska producers  said it is too early to talk about who will build or operate the pipeline  because his group has not even decided to proceed with one yet. He noted that a preliminary analysis done as part of a $100-million study the group has undertaken indicates a pipeline couldn t pay for itself at current commodity prices. However  no decision has been made  he insisted. Some of the other options floated include building a pipeline off the north shore of Alaska and Yukon to gas fields in the Northwest Territories  then down the Mackenzie Valley of the NWT  or a pipeline going over land in Yukon to the NWT. There are various backers for each proposal and the Alaskan producers have not ruled out undertaking a project themselves. Joe Handley  the Minister of Finance for the NWT  said news of the partnership is a spur to participants in the proposed Mackenzie Valley pipeline. The territory s government has consistently said an NWT pipeline must be built first or risk being derailed by an Alaska pipeline that would flood the market with product. "If we don t keep on our toes  [an Alaska pipeline] could pass us and leave us in the bush " he said. Foothills announced earlier this week that it reached a preliminary agreement with the Kaska Nation  removing another potential hurdle to the Alaska pipeline proposal.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  Nov. 16  2001Houston ChronicleNew Power faults data flow but opposes program delay By LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle The New Power Co.  a major player in the state s test pilot of electricity deregulation  said Thursday that problems getting data from other entities have caused it to send out customer bills late and without all the appropriate charges. But New Power  an electricity provider  is hopeful problems can be resolved and doesn t believe the state should delay the planned Jan. 1 start of electricity deregulation. Delays and computer glitches have plagued the pilot program  which let a limited number of consumers across the state choose power providers before the opening of the full market. New Power and other electricity companies made comments Thursday in filings with the Public Utility Commission. The PUC will use them as it evaluates whether to move forward on Jan. 1. Several other companies also cited some ongoing problems. New Power  which enrolled more than 61 000 customers in the pilot  said a majority of its customers are getting late bills and that it has issued initial customer bills for lower amounts than what s due. Before New Power can issue accurate bills  it needs information from separate companies that maintain electricity transmission and metering systems. That information is sent to New Power through the Electric Reliability Council of Texas  which runs a variety of computer systems need for deregulation. A New Power spokeswoman said executives have met with the companies and ERCOT about the problem and the situation seems to be improving. Reliant Resources  the Houston parent of electricity provider Reliant Energy Retail Services  said in its filing that it is "confident that any remaining significant issues will be overcome" in time to open the market Jan. 1. Near the end of last month  nine retail electricity providers told the PUC they opposed delaying the planned start date of deregulation. A coalition of consumer groups has called for a delay  saying the state isn t ready for a variety of reasons. But the electricity companies  which included Reliant and New Power  said the market shortcomings the consumer groups cited either don t exist or can be fixed and don t require a delay. Consortium s return sparks renewed hope in gas pipeline projectBy MIKE CHAMBERSAssociated Press Writer11/15/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.JUNEAU (AP) - A natural gas consortium plans to resurrect its proposal to build a 1 700-mile gas pipeline through Alaska to the Lower 48  sparking renewed hope in the massive undertaking just as oil companies were doubting its viability. The nine American and Canadian companies announced plans on Thursday to offer to build and maintain the pipeline in an effort to ship 36 trillion cubic feet of North Slope natural gas.The group intends to make a proposal to the three major oil companies by December  a spokesman for the consortium said. "The economic benefits of this multi-billion dollar project would impact most regions of the U.S. and Canada " said Mike Stewart  co-chief executive officer of Foothills Pipe Lines. Foothills reached the agreement with TransCanada PipeLines  Westcoast Energy and American companies Williams  Duke Energy  El Paso Corp.  Enron  PG&E Corp. and Sempra Energy International. The groups comprise the original Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Company which had first proposed building this project in the 1970s. Under the terms of the agreement  the companies plan to dismiss $4 billion in costs and interest associated with the dormant project that would have been charged to developers of the pipeline. The money represents their original investment  with interest. "Their intention is to remove that as an issue " said Foothills spokesman Rocco Ciancio. That was seen as a key roadblock to building an all-Alaska pipeline to the Lower 48 by officials with the state  which would own 12.5 percent of any natural gas pumped out of the North Slope. "Now that that s been resolved  it s time the producers come to the table with pipeline companies  the State of Alaska and other players to get this project underway " said Gov. Tony Knowles. Exxon Mobil  Phillips and BP have spent millions studying the viability of the project and  so far  have determined it is not profitable. Knowles and other state officials have been pressuring the oil companies to build a route that generally follows the trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline and the Alaska Highway to Alberta. It would provide jobs for Alaskans  cheap natural gas to communities and revenues for state services  Knowles said. But Canadian officials have pushed for a Beaufort Sea route that taps into rich reserves stranded in the Mackenzie Delta. The oil companies estimate the Canadian route would cost $15.1 billion compared to the Alaska Highway route  which would cost $17 billion. Ciancio said his group estimates a pipeline would cost $9.7 billion to construct and would get the natural gas to market quicker than other proposals. The consortium has held permits to build the all-Alaska route since 1976. "We re estimating it would take a greenfield (start up) project somewhere near two to three years to reach the same state of readiness as this project " Ciancio said. The consortium s project proposes running a 42-inch pipe from Prudhoe Bay to Alberta where the companies have other pipelines to ship natural gas to Chicago and San Francisco  he said. If agreements are reached quickly with the oil companies  the pipeline could be in operation by 2008  Ciancio said. A spokesman for the oil producers team which is studying the project greeted the news and said it would welcome any pipeline plan that would be profitable. "We re happy to see efforts being made to support an Alaska pipeline project " said Dave MacDowell  spokesman for the oil producer s group. "We re absolutely open to folks coming forward with efficient economic projects."Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc. All Rights Reserved.  USA: Janus funds dumped EMC in third quarter.By Christopher Noble11/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.BOSTON  Nov 15 (Reuters) - Mutual fund giant Janus Capital Corp. dumped 40 million shares of data storage leader EMC Corp. in the third quarter  cutting deeply into its stake in the one time high flyer while the company s stock plunged 59 percent. According to regulatory filings  Janus  a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc. ended the third quarter with 6.38 million shares in EMC  down from 46.44 million at the end of the second quarter.Janus funds also cut storage software maker Veritas Software Co.   dropping nearly eight million shares in the quarter. But Janus added about 570 000 shares to its holding of Network Appliance   bringing it to 1.97 million shares. A spokeswoman for Janus declined to comment on the sale of EMC stock  but the company ran into trouble as revenue shrank due to stiffer competition and a steep downturn in corporate spending on information technology. Another big move was the sale of about 43.6 million shares of mobile phone maker Nokia . Janus ended the quarter with 183.2 million shares of Nokia  down from 226.8 million in the previous quarter  the filing showed. The filing shows more sales of technology companies but does not indicate a big move out of the tech sector the way previous quarterly data sometimes has. For instance  its second-quarter filing showed big moves out of many of the biggest names of the Internet revolution  including Cisco Systems   EMC  Oracle Corp and Sun Microsystems   the so-called "four horsemen" of the Web  that helped drive the expansion of the "New Economy." While Janus again cut sharply into its stake in Sun - dropping 14.7 million shares - its holdings of Cisco and Oracle were nearly unchanged in the quarter  the filing showed. Janus also cut about 12.6 million shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. . On the other hand  the company added some 13.6 million shares of Microsoft Corp. and boosted its stakes in JDS Uniphase and EBay Inc. . The funds also more than doubled their holdings in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to 320 691 shares. The filing showed that Janus made almost no change in the third quarter to its holding of Enron Corp.   the energy trading company whose stock collapsed amid a U.S. regulatory probe. At the end of the quarter  Janus held 41.36 million shares in Enron. The Janus spokeswoman would not comment on the Enron shares  but said that the filings are dated and don t necessarily reflect current holdings. Shares of Enron plunged in mid-October as investors rebelled over the company s off-the-balance-sheet deals that are now under investigation. Enron whose stock is off 63 percent so far in the fourth quarter. The company agreed last week to be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion in stock. Janus s stake in Exxon Mobil Corp. more than doubled to 39.8 million shares in the quarter. Janus s stock holdings were worth $102.09 billion at the end of the quarter  down from $141.05 billion at the end of the second quarter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc.

Cash Infusion Little Comfort To Enron CounterpartiesBy Andrew DowellOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES11/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001  Dow Jones & Company  Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- One and a half billion dollars doesn t go as far as it used to. Despite a cash injection of that size from Dynegy Inc. (DYN) this week  U.S. energy companies continue to restrict their dealings with Enron Corp. (ENE)  traders in the U.S. power and natural gas markets said Wednesday.Traders said they were doing deals with the Houston-based energy giant when necessary  and some reported that activity appears to have picked up. But traders said they were continuing to limit their exposure and doing business with other parties if possible until Enron s credit rating improves. "It s a company with one foot on a banana peel and one foot in the grave " said Ed Kennedy  a Miami-based trader with Pioneer Futures. Both Moody s Investors Service and Standard & Poor s rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody s has Enron s ratings on review for a downgrade  and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Enron s ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings. Tuesday s infusion of cash from Dynegy  which has agreed to buy Enron in a stock-swap currently worth about $10 billion  isn t enough to change the outlook for Enron  said Todd Shipman  a director in the U.S. utilities group at S&P. Instead  the firm will be watching to see whether Enron can hold on to its core business of trading North American gas and power. If it does  S&P may revisit Enron s credit-watch status after New Year s with an eye to upgrading it to "positive " Shipman said. Circular Reasoning That sets up a staredown of sorts between the ratings agency and the energy markets  with each waiting for the other to take the first step. "It always has been a sort of face-off " Shipman said. "For the time being  we re standing pat unless the situation at Enron gets significantly worse." Moody s wasn t immediately available for comment. Traders and their companies said consistently that until Enron s credit ratings improve  they will continue to watch their exposure to Enron carefully  with trades limited to short-term deals. Mirant Corp. (MIR) is trading with Enron on "a very limited basis" that won t be broadened until Enron s credit situation improves  spokesman Chuck Griffin said. Aquila Corp. (ILA) CEO Keith Stamm said the company was heartened by Dynegy s injection of cash and was continuing to monitor Enron s condition. "The $1.5 billion has improved their situation with us  and we ll keep watching the situation " Stamm said. On Monday  Aquila said it had whittled down its exposure to Enron significantly. Enron spokesman Eric Thode said 30-day-moving-average volumes on EnronOnline  the Internet-based trading platform on which Enron is the counterparty in every deal  have improved to a more typical 5 700 transactions per day with a notional value of $2.7 billion. "Volumes have returned to the normal range " he said. Some traders said Enron s short-term business does appear to have picked up from earlier this week. Staffing Changes A Concern Enron is the country s largest trader of natural gas and electricity  accounting for up to a quarter of both markets by some estimates. Even when companies aren t prohibiting their traders from doing business with Enron  some traders are taking steps on their own to limit exposure. One funds analyst said the possibility of staffing changes at Enron are contributing to traders  reluctance to do business with the company. "You have headhunters out there " the analyst said. "Why tie yourself down with a five-year deal with someone who may not be there?" Enron currently employes about 1 500 people in its trading operation  and Dynegy employes some 300. The acquisition is expected to produce cuts  but Dynegy hasn t said to what degree. Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month  as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with distressed debt. Enron s restatement of four and a half years  worth of earnings last Thursday and ratings downgrades Friday led some companies to severely restrict their business with Enron  even if that meant paying higher prices or accepting lower bids to do so. Enron s ability to recover that business is critical to its future  S&P s Shipman said. A stable trading operation will keep Dynegy interested in the buyout  which is the key to keeping Enron s credit ratings out of junk-bond territory. "That s the crown jewel  and that s what Enron needs to protect " he said. If counterparties pull back  "then I think we would have a little more cause for worry about the Dynegy deal." -By Andrew Dowell  Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4430; andrew.dowell@dowjones.com (John Edmiston in Houston  Jon Kamp in Chicago and Mark Golden in New York contributed to this article.)Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc.

Dynegy May Want Some Of Enron s Broadband AssetsBy Erwin SebaOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES11/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001  Dow Jones & Company  Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) may be planning to unwind its Broadband Services unit  but before it can do so  it may have to gain approval from its future new owner. Dynegy Inc. (DYN) is just beginning to look at which assets it wants to keep from Enron s non-core businesses."What we re saying at this point very  very early on is that we want to look and see if there are pieces of (the optical fiber network) that complement our strategy " Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser told Dow Jones Newswires. "And we re going to take the opportunity to review that." One thing is clear  though: Enron is leaving the bandwidth market in which the company has been the principal market-maker. "I think we ve made it pretty clear what our non-core businesses are " Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Shelly Mansfield told Dow Jones. "We re going to be exiting those businesses in an orderly fashion." But Thursday morning Enron bandwidth traders said they haven t been told what will become of them. Many of them came to the bandwidth desk from the company s energy trading operations. "I ve not been given any definitive information " a trader said. Traders and brokers who are counterparties to Enron said Enron s traders remain active in the bandwidth market  regularly showing prices for various contracts. Dynegy traders are also present in the market  but not as pervasively as Enron traders have been  said one broker. Dynegy s traders regularly show a high offer price without presenting a bid price  a broker said. Usually Dynegy traders will stay with that high offer expecting buyers in the market to come to them. Also  the broker said  Dynegy seems most active with contracts on the New York-Miami route. In addition to deciding what to do with Enron s network  Dynegy also faces decisions about whether to retain Enron s bandwidth traders and the contracts the company still holds for bandwidth services. Guiding Dynegy s decisions will be a continuing commitment to its own bandwidth strategy. "Dynegy has been focused on building very long-term customer relationships " Rosser said. "We are focused  just as we have been in our energy business  on being a value-added provider to our customers. We have maintained a focus on the wholesale market...and large enterprise consumers of bandwidth. We have maintained focus on structured transactions and not trading  primarily because we don t think a true trading environment exists yet." While Enron may attempt to sell its network in the nine to 12 months before the merger is completed  it may be unable to do so  brokers of physical assets and bandwidth said. Most optical networks are being broken up for sale  said physical assets brokers. -By Erwin Seba  Dow Jones Newswires  713-547-9214 erwin.seba@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company  Inc.

In a nutshell  he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific  trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language  although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided  it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if  as he said  the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC  not set by statute.Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler  th chief counsel  is a drafting stickler).Others should obviously weigh in and review this  but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today)  here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13)  under "information required" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:(2)  each broker  exchange  or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information  this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes  etc.As to the "timely basis" of information release (subsection (c))  the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data  question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want  I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:"(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.The change is to add "appropriate" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of "appropriate" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like "consistent with ..." or "promote competition" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure  not when disclosure is appropriate.Please let me have your thoughts  although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum  Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue  but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.

Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite  probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it s time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron s success. I would like suggestions as to:1)  Where to go.2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I m not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 4)  And any other ideas you have.In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland  Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    RegardsJohn

Don t want to repeat the nightmare.I want to put as much discretion as possible in the hands of the business units.  The "strawman" we re looking at would have a very basic matrix  with a discretionary business unit component (that really gives the OTC s the freedom to do what they want).

I understand from Richard that part of the settlement will be an agreement that will allow Enron Corp to continue to lease the Ardmore facility as a data center. I just wanted to remind everyone that the lease also needs to allow Enron to provide space to NETCO for its hardware during a transition period until NETCO can relocate its hardware to a new data center.  The lease also needs to make it clear that access to the Ardmore facility needs to be under Enron s control.Similarily the software license that Enron will retain covering all the Enron developed software will also need to provide that Enron can use the covered software to provide services to third parties such as AEP  Bridgeline and Northern Natural Gas. If anyone has any questions  please give me a call.       Anne C.

It seems to be getting a little large and I think we need to make sure we are only bringing people that can add significant value to the actual meeting.My count is as follows:Marc Ulrich - URM - He is the commercial expert on ComEd and rate effects on our business - MandatoryJeff Merola - Manager of Physical Delivery Logistics for Central Region - mandatoryBrad Snyder - Structured supply Mark Bernstein - Structured SupplyJeff Ader - Structured SupplyJanine Migden - RegulatoryRoy Boston - RegulatoryRogersHerndon - EWS RiskName I forgot - Legal - Ulrich recomended he go given the ComEd audienceThis would be 9.  I think this is too much.  What are your thoughts?  Given the agenda items of 1) ComEd PPO phase-out intentions  2) Physical Delivery Issues and 3) Potential Business Transactions b/w ComEd and Enron  I think we need to trim the list of attendees.

Do you want  meto make  noise  tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter?Until then  I wanted to discuss with you an idea  that Les and I have beenthrowing around concerning writing a series of articles  for Risk s  Energy andPower Risk Management . We would like to propose to  them?that we would write anarticle a month  covering practical issues  dealing with energy modelling andenergy derivative pricing and risk management.  The articles would be based uponsections of the book so as to promote the book   and to reduce the effort/timeinvolved by using?already produced material.  We would like to cover some verypractical topics  but we?won t be giving  too much away as the articles are only1 or 2 pages long.Each article would be of?the  form;- introduce?the concept- give an example using real data- discuss the problem with a case study- provide a discussion- sum upI ve included a list of potential articles at the  end of this e-mail. Forexample  for the first one   "Estimation of mean reversion in spot energyprices"  we would introduce  the concept of mean reversion ?show a graph of anequity index and an  energy price?for illustration of our point  estimate theparameter for a  series of energies over a number of seasons  and finally discuss the  results.We?are wondering if you would like to be  involved in this project? Yourinvolvement needn t take much time (although it  is up to you). The kind ofinput we are hoping for (again  this is up to you) is  that you?would?review thelist of articles and  provide?suggestions of additions or deletions  suggestreasonable data sets  or case studies to work with on each article  and then torun your eye over  "near finished" articles  which?we would supply to you foryour?practical experience?input.? Would something like this  interest you? If itdid  we would try to sell Risk on making it a regular  monthly "feature" ofEPRM  authored by all three of us.We are hoping to present our proposal to Risk in  the next few weeks  so pleaselet us know if you are interested.Best regards.Chris.Potental EPRM articles;1- Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy  prices (with parametersestimated for oil  gas  and electricity data over  different seasons)2- Estimation of jumps in spot energy prices (with  parameters estimated foroil  gas  and electricity data over different  seasons)3- Simulating a mean reverting spot price process  for pricing energyderivatives (with case study applied to an Asian option on  oil)4- Simulating a jump / diffusion spot price process  for pricing energyderivatives (with case study applied to a Swaption on natural  gas)5- Simulating a mean reverting jump / diffusion  spot price process for pricingenergy derivatives (with case study applied to  hourly caps on spot electricity)6- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a mean reverting spotprice model (with example applied to a cap on natural  gas fitting the Forwardcurve and volatlity structure)7- using a tree consistent with the forward curve  and vols for pricing swingoptions8- implying a single?factor vol function from  market Futures option prices andvariation of parameters thru time9- adding jump volatility to the tree10- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps  in a multi-factor forwardcurve model(with example applied to the same cap on  natural gas and adiscussion on the differences between the two  approaches)11- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve models (withestimates of oil data over different  periods)12- Estimating volatility functions for  multi-factor forward curve model frommarket option prices13- pricing swing option in multi factor model  using tree for exercise strategy14- comparison of VaR methodoligies applied to the  same energy derivativportfolio.

Eleven were merchants  nine werefarmers and large plantation owners; men of means  well educated. But theysigned the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penaltywould be death if they were captured.Carter Braxton of Virginia  a wealthy planter and trader  saw his shipsswept from the seas by the British Navy.  He sold his home and properties topay his debts  and died in rags.Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move hisfamily almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay  and hisfamily was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him  and povertywas his reward.Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery  Hall  Clymer  Walton Gwinnett  Heyward  Rutledge  and Middleton.At the battle of Yorktown  Thomas Nelson Jr  noted that the British GeneralCornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters.  He quietlyurged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed  andNelson died bankrupt.Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed.  The enemy jailed hiswife  and she died within a few months.John Hart was driven from his wife s bedside as she was dying. Their 13children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid towaste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves  returning home tofind his wife dead and his children vanished. A few weeks later he died fromexhaustion and a broken heart.Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates.Such were the stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution. These werenot wild-eyed  rabble-rousing ruffians. They were soft-spoken men of meansand education. They had security  but they valued liberty more.  Standingtall  straight  and unwavering  they pledged: "For the support of thisdeclaration  with firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence we mutually pledge to each other  our lives  our fortunes  and our sacredhonor."They gave you and me a free and independent America.  The history booksnever told you a lot about what happened in the Revolutionary War.  Wedidn t fight just the British. We were British subjects at that time and wefought our own government!Some of us take these liberties so much for granted  but we shouldn t.  So take a few minutes while enjoying your 4th of July holiday and silentlythank these patriots. It s not much to ask for the price they paid.Remember: freedom is never free!  Patriotism is NOT a sin  and the Fourth ofJuly has more to it than beer  picnics  and baseball games.something to think about...

Moreover  the==20audit of the utilities and its recommendation for the share of utility debt==20to be paid by the state versus the parent companies is not yet finalized (s=ee=20below).The industrial users are unhappy with this bill because they will bear the==20burden of the costs.  Approximately 35% of power customers in CA are=20residential  and another approximately 10% are commercial or users with=20emergency status; this means that half or more of all power customers in CA==20will benefit from price controls on their power.  This  in turn  leaves the==20large industrial customers footing the bill.  They are saying that this may==20result in job losses and may even give them incentive to leave the state.The State of California is talking about issuing revenue bonds to pay off t=he=20utilities=01  debt.  There is an important but subtle difference between th=ese=20and general obligation bonds  which draw from tax revenues and assets to pa=y=20debt.  Revenue bonds draw from the revenue gained from actually using=20something.  For example  a stadium developer might issue revenue bonds to p=ay=20for a new stadium  then make revenue from the team that uses the stadium. ==20How will that work in the case of the utilities?  There is no guarantee tha=t=20there will be positive revenue to pay back the bonds.=20California=01 s interruptible power contracts have a 100-hour/year limit.  =Most=20of those contracts are at or near that limit and will become firm power=20contracts.  This removes another option for finding power.2. The Audit:Many of the details in AB18X are subject to the results of the audit and th=e=20power auction.  Governor Davis has commissioned a study which shows that 43==20percent of the PG&E and SoCal Edison debt is owed to their parent companies=. =20He views this as the minimum acceptable percentage that the parent companie=s=20should contribute to a bailout.The companies cannot simply eat the cost of their inter-company debt.  They==20do not have the cash to do so.  The question becomes  if the subsidiaries==01 =20bills are not paid  will they be forced to go into bankruptcy?3. The Auction:As told by us to some of you yesterday afternoon and as reported by the Wal=l=20Street Journal this morning  the low bids that have been announced from=20Wednesday=01 s auction are based on off-peak power.  This is why they are s=o=20low.  It is estimated that if Davis were to include off-peak power  the bid=s=20would be closer to 9.5 cents per kilowatt hour. =20Governor Davis is not disclosing the "true bid price" because to do so woul=d=20not be "in the public interest."  While they legally can keep the auction==20terms secret  this makes an excellent bluff to try to get other power=20providers to bid lower for peak power.Since the real cost of power is higher than the auction price is making it==20appear  this means that there may actually be little or no margin between==20where the state buys power and where the utilities sell it.  No margin woul=d=20mean no funds to pay down utility debt.4. The Rest of the WestThe federal order for other states to supply CA with power requires Oregon==20and Washington to draw down their own reservoirs.  The people of OR and WA==20are understandably upset about this.  It is not clear how much longer this==20can continue  as reservoir levels continue to drop.The problem is the drought impacting the entire Northwest is not getting an=y=20better even as Washington and Oregon hydroelectric plants dump water throug=h=20their dams to keep the lights on this winter. Officials in these states are==20now bracing for electricity surcharges that could hit 50% by mid-summer and==20increase the casualties on the dot-com laden killing field.  Cities from=20Seattle to Tacoma and beyond are already passing legislation that scales in==20electricity surcharges that high and more. Seattle raised prices by 10% the==20first of January  with a further  emergency 18% increase is set to pass the==20city council on Monday. And city political officials warn that another 25%==20increase would be in effect by mid-summer -- unless the federal government==20agrees to plans by the western governors to request an emergency price cap==20for the summer.Although the Clinton administration and Bush administration steadfastly=20refused to impose such a price cap when Governor Davis requested it many=20times in the last month  western governors told our sources that they hope==20the political and economic considerations will change by late spring.=20"Although FERC head Hebert is a free-market freak " one government official==20told our sources  "this is very different than the price cap request=20California made. First  you could legitimately say California s problems st=em=20from their screwed up de-regulation plan. But the west s problems this summ=er=20stem from a drought  and that is significantly different. Second  the Bush==20administration may want to punish Davis with thoughts of 2004 presidential==20politics in their head  but that will not apply to all of us across the=20Northwest and Southwest. We have a lot of Republicans on the hook here.=20Third  even if you think damage to the US economy from California s trouble=s=20won t be that great  the damage of 50% energy surcharges rolling across the==20entire western United States from Arizona to Washington has to get Bush s -=-=20or at least Cheney s -- attention."There is almost no snowpack in most of the northwest  according to these=20officials  so the usual rebuilding of water reserves necessary to generate==20electricity will not occur. Add to that the fact Northwest dams are being r=un=20harder than usual to keep up with the maxed-out energy demands across the==20west  and you have the makings of a mid-summer economic disaster. "The=20reservoir behind Grand Coulee dam (the country s largest) is dropping at a==20foot a day since New Year s and there is no sign of that slowing " one=20official told our sources.

Part of the diagram hopes to separate the special interests as participants and memberorganizations so as to be helpful in the public sector with social issues.

One is as afinancial economist.  The other as the Director of the newly formed "GlobalMobility Innovation Initiative (GMII) -- this is the research projectfunded by Lucent  involving BU  LBS  and INSEAD  to study various aspectsof the mobile Internet (read 3G).On the former I am working with a couple of Ph.D. students in understanding(a) details of how having physical supply (inventory) can be used by amarket maker.   This is a problem that has been studies in the context ofspecialists inventory in the stock market but I think really interesting inthe way Enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth.    Ithink this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber  that is in theground.(b) how Enron is disciplining the internal decision making process withmarket.  This is in many ways the critical aspect of  real options thatmost finance people miss -- having options is one thing but exercising themand realizing their value is another.  All of the incomplete contracting asymmetric information  and incentive issues are ignored in real optionsvaluation models.  But they are real in practice.  My impression is Enron sreal success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigatethese problems by imposing a market disciplining.(c) how Enron manages the various books that involve physicals  financials credit etc.  This is specially important when many of the real assets haveoptions features and therefore  include non-linear risk profiles.  Thestory of gas  is pretty well understood but not many of the others marketsEnron has been moving into over the last few years.On the GMII front  I think that some interesting opportunities arise whenyou think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber.   I amworking with several people at Lucent on this issue.  I think it would bewonderful to engage in a conversation with Enron and Lucent folks in the room.I can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues.  Perhaps we can discusssome of these over a conference call. Clearly  having Vince Kaminski in theroom would be very important to me.As for schedules  the first 3 weeks of April are horrible.

I will follow up today with a phone call toanswer any questions you may have.As always we appreciate your time and support.Thanks JozefThe Eastern European students at MIT Sloan School of Management arepreparing an Eastern European week to be held in March 2001.  The one-weeklong program will familiarize our classmates with many of the countriesthat are going through the post communist transformation. As you well know Eastern Europe has a great deal of opportunities for many companies.Unfortunately  it also presents many obstacles that make most of theopportunities difficult to capture.Because we believe that we can help to eliminate some of these obstacles we want to bring the Eastern European experience to MIT Sloan School ofManagement.  Familiarizing the future business leaders with the countriesis only one step toward reforming Eastern Europe  but we believe it isworth our time and effort.During the week  we plan to bring series of lectures addressing thebusiness environment in Eastern Europe.  We want to emphasize especiallythe success stories from Eastern Europe.  Such companies as Enron Volkswagen  ExxonMobil  GM  and GE have entered the Eastern European marketand show commitment to stay in it.  In at least one panel discussion withacademic experts and industry participants we hope to let everyone knowthat Eastern Europe is a real place for business.In addition to the educational activities  we are preparing number ofcultural events that will introduce the culture of this area.The scope of our program depends greatly on the funds we will be able toraise from our sponsors.  In return  we plan to advertise our sponsors inevery activity we will do.  We will make banners and any other appropriateadvertising as desired by the sponsor.  Should a sponsor be willing to senda speaker for the panel discussion or to give a speech/lecture we wouldappreciate the enrichment to our program.The advertising will reach nearly 700 Sloan students and faculty.  Inaddition  the advertising will reach all newly admitted students  as theywill visit our campus for the AdMIT day (an official program to sell ourschool to the admitted students).

It is almost unbelievable to me that the company I worked forthis summer is now essentially kaput.From the website I contacted you from  I take it that you are no longer withEnron.  Please accept my deepest sympathies and best wishes in what mustsurely be a difficult time.  I hope you were not as heavily invested in Enronas many employees seemed to be.I wanted to contact you regarding letters of recommendation.  I m currentlylooking for summer employment  in particular at network providers (such asAT&T and IBM) as well as some financial institutions.  Would it be anytrouble for you to write a note on my behalf?  They may be requested viaemail  so an actual letter may not be necessary.  I would have more detailslater.My best to you and your family and all those I knew this summer ---EricOn Tuesday 22 January 2002 06:05 pm  you wrote:> Eric >> Nice to hear from you.

He is currently anassistant professor in our program and a highly valued member  ofour department. We hate to lose him  however his interest has shiftedfrom the academic arena to one of high level but practical applicationand development of statistical methodologies includingstochastic modeling.Keith is actually a graduate of our Ph.D. program; he was in the samegroup of students as Martin Lawera. Keith spent several years at LosAlamos National Lab before we recruited him back to Rice. He hasbeen on our faculty now for three years and it is my expectation(and that of my colleagues) that if he remained he would receivetenure.Keith has a strong interest in financial models and the backgroundto support his interest. He is also a leading expert in statisticalcomputing  empirical likelihood  categorical models and areasof statistics falling under the general bailiwick of "data mining".He is a creative thinker.I do not know if there are possibilities for Keith within your group howeverI believe it is an excellent match of talent and objectives.

no.address@enron.com, All Enron Houston@ENRON,The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron  the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.However  should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening  please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses  we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

chairman.ken@enron.com,dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide1@enron.com,Today  we announced plans to merge with Dynegy  a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ve worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.Deal Terms-- The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example  each 1 000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing  plus cash for fractional shares  upon closing.-- ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy s outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron s Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals  and is expected to close late next year.Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy s $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron s Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.Management of Newly Formed CompanyChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company  which will be called Dynegy Inc.  and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth  efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine  providing great opportunities for our employees  shareholders and customers.  As with any merger  some elimination of positions is almost inevitable  and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly  we cannot rule out involuntary separation  but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.As I said in my video  this is a day like no other in our company s history.  We considered several options  but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence  strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.

If you receive any calls from the media  please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors  we are opening new ones  as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise  including our market reach  financial strength and industry experience.

But I need help understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John s behind the citygate deals  Since  the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia   we never nominate this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of these deals occurs  we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to account for these transactions internally.It s my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create  track and balance like usual. Is that not the case here?  Is this something that s getting reconciled in Jeanne and Terry s project for CNG???By cc: Angie  please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!  Please keep me abreast of the status.

chris.germany@enron.com,kareng@accessrelocation.com,I did take a look at the $139 000 home.  This house has been on the market for awhile.  The backyard sits next to some big building - that s a bad thing.  I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though.  Based on what I ve seen over the last 8 months  it would take something around $190 s - $205 s to make me happy and I m not willing to spend that much right now.Another thing that bothers me is the economy.  All I hear about are layoffs.  The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining.  That s what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house.Thanks for the info though. -----Original Message-----From:  "karen gillespie" <kareng@accessrelocation.com>@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22karen+20gillespie+22+20+3Ckareng+40accessrelocation+2Ecom+3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com] Sent: Tuesday  May 29  2001 3:11 PMTo: Germany  ChrisSubject: FOLLOW-UPHI CHRIS HOPE YOU HAD A NICE LONG WEEKEND.

Sidelines will document the season of a prominent team as told through the eyes and ears of the less visible  less celebrated people who are involved with the team.  The football Aggies of Texas A&M will be the focus of the series  premiere episodes to begin October 5. "Coach Slocum and I made the decision to be a part of this exciting venture with ESPN " Texas A&M Athletics Director Wally Groff said.  "We couldn t be more thrilled that ESPN has chosen Texas A&M for this series.  The opportunity ESPN gave us to showcase this wonderful institution and all of its tradition and heritage is something we could not pass up." In a "docu-drama" style  the various stories that surround the team will be explored through the voices and actions of people whose day-to-day lives are directly affected by living in the town and/or going to the school. Players and coaches will also be visible and heard from in a more peripheral fashion  but will not be the primary focus. "This is a good opportunity for Texas A&M University and we re delighted ESPN decided to feature the football program and some of the people behind the scenes " Head Coach R.C. Slocum said. "We look forward to working with them." The participants will be drawn from a cross section of people who reflect every aspect of the University and College Station  Texas.  They will be students  faculty  media  local storeowners  mothers  fathers and some of the high school seniors who aspire to attend the University. "Each person has a role to play with the team  as well as a personal story " said Mark Shapiro  vice president and general manager  ESPN Original Entertainment.  "Sidelines will see each person grow in character as the season progresses -- a kind of  soap-umentary.  We ll weave the smaller personal stories together through the bigger story of the progression and fate of the team and its season." SIDELINES: TEXAS A&M STORYLINES --This is the 125th anniversary of the school s founding (1876). --The community is still very much dealing with the 1999 bonfire collapse which tragically killed 12 students almost two years ago.  A 90-year tradition came to a tumultuous end.  Dealing with the loss and the emotional toll it took on faculty members  students and families will be an important part of this series.  The bonfire will return in 2002 but will take on a different form than has been tradition. --Texas A&M  who lost a wild  snowy Independence Bowl last year in overtime to Mississippi State 43-41  will play Notre Dame (at home)  Texas  Oklahoma  Kansas St and Colorado next year.  A tough schedule will provide for great drama. --The school invented the phrase "12th Man" and actually owns the trademark. One game  the Aggies were low on players and had a student suit up and stand ready just in case he was needed. Ever since  a student is chosen for every home game to suit up and play on the kickoff team. --Billy Pickard is in charge of maintaining the facilities. He s been at the University for 36 years and was the student trainer for Bear Bryant s A&M team. He was actually in Junction  Texas for Bryant s infamous grueling summer camp. The story of it was a best-selling book  The Junction Boys. --At midnight on the Friday night before every home game  A&M students gather at the stadium for what is called "Midnight Yell Practice;" 30 000 fans show up each week for this time-honored tradition. EOE  the newest franchise of ESPN Programming  will develop a wide-variety of branded programming outside of the network s traditional event and sports news genres. Using a collection of vehicles -- game shows  documentaries or reality-based shows - it s ESPN s goal to broaden its audience by appealing to younger and casual sports fans.  In addition  the company is exploring new ways to connect with consumers by applying these projects across all platforms of the ESPN family - television  Internet  radio -aTm-

Guide and blessthese men and women who have been sent to direct us tothe center of Your will and to openly ask these thingsin the name of Your Son  the living Savior  JesusChrist.  " Amen.!! "The response was immediate. A number of legislatorswalked out during the prayer in protest.  In 6 shortweeks  Central Christian Church  where Rev. Wright ispastor  logged more than 5 000 phone calls with only47 of those calls responding negatively.  The churchis now receiving international requests for copies ofthis prayer from India  Africa  and Korea.Commentator Paul Harvey aired this prayer on his radioprogram  " The Rest of the Story "  and received alarger response to this program than any other he hasever aired. With the Lord s help  may this prayersweep over our nation and wholeheartedly become ourdesire so that we again can be called  " one nationunder God. " If possible  please pass this prayer onto your friends.  Think about this: If you forwardthis prayer to everyone on your email list in lessthan 30 days it would be heard by the world.__________________________________________________Terrorist Attacks on U.S. - How can you help?Donate cash  emergency relief informationhttp://dailynews.yahoo.com/fc/US/Emergency_Information/

Productivity and real income growth have recovered  unemployment is at lower levels than a decade ago  and the country s industrial structure has shifted away from a commodity and manufacturing base  the study said."A healthy  long-term economy will boost housing markets by keeping real incomes growing  real interest rates low  and providing confidence in the future performance of real estate assets."Pamela Alexander  chief executive of ReMax Ontario-Atlantic Canada  said Calgary would be the hottest market in the country thanks to increasing oilpatch activity  migration from other parts of the country and its youthful population."Calgary is going through its renaissance period " Ms. Alexander said  adding that its average home price of $180 000 is still 30% to 35% cheaper than Vancouver or Toronto.Toronto  with its average house price of $250 000  should see growth of 10% to 15%  Ms. Alexander said  because its population is heavily weighted toward 25 to 40 year olds -- who will buy their first home or upgrade -- and because of the scarcity of rental units.Meanwhile  Ottawa  despite the high-tech downturn  remained one of the hottest housing markets with prices up 10% from a year ago. That market is expected to grow as the federal government increases spending and creates new departments  older civil servants retire and new people are brought in  and the high-tech sector rebounds.

sally.beck@enron.com,patti.thompson@enron.com,Please check the dates for that OpRisk seminar in New York and put those on my calendar tentatively.  I got a message from Shona trying to schedule a trip to Mexico and she thought that the week of February 5th looked good.  I assume that she checked with you and that my calendar looked clear.  While I have not yet made a decision on attending the NY seminar  I do need to hold those dates.  I left Shona a message telling her that the week of February 19 would be better.  --Sally

Of the 23 students which interviewed  3 are current or former Enron interns (Clay Shamblin  Michelle Terry  and Nadege Assale).I have designated $1500 from my budget to be awarded at the EM Spring Awards Banquet which will be held April 20 on campus.  I met with Jody Crook yesterday  and it is our recommendation to award $500 to Clay  Michelle  and Nadege.  I think this will help impress upon the students how Enron values its interns.The remaining candidates which interviewed ranged from Freshmen to Seniors  and I do not feel that awarding them money at this point would necessarily improve our success on campus.I look forward to your feedback.Regards lexi

As far as the right time  you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest (global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am copying them on this memo. When your schedule is set  I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with a copy of the schedule (dates  names and contact numbers).  Please send me a copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation times will be very much appreciated.

SAP had a major system crash the day Willie finaled his supply verification in Unify.  Before Willie went into SAP to net the payable (same day)  SAP crashed.  By the time SAP came up  the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the cash.  When we issued the recall  the money was already out the door.As a result  we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify.  This causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until the payment block is removed.  This policy went into effect at the beginning of September.  However  this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure works.  To ensure we don t "accidentally" release cash  I have asked Unify IT to change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked  which will require the coordinator to release funds.  This is an added step  but is worth it considering the stakes.  This change will go into effect on Monday  9/25.  If you have any questions  please let me know.Bryce    Enron North America Corp.

This is fine  and then Willie was going to net the A/P and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced  but before Willie was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day  the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If you have any further questions about this  call me.  Thanks.

You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty s that net on SAP  although because of timing  the override did not take place.Thank you Russell

brent.price@enron.com,sally.beck@enron.com,FYI...according to Jeff  by the end of today the only position that will require manual adjustment is an IM Canada position (60 K s) that will be fixed next Monday when Kam Keiser goes back to Calgary.  Everything else is now automatically feeding to the GRMS system (and VAR calculations) without human intervention. ---------------------- Forwarded by Brent A Price/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 10:20 AM ---------------------------    Enron North America Corp.

Here are the things which we discussed earlier.Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.  We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS.  2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S. office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly.3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books into the system.  4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in more than one book per region.Issues remaining:Intra-Month CanadaChicagoStorage and Intra-EastIntra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to Canada on Monday to fix their problems.Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the wrong portfolio code.Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide books need to be set up.ThanksJG

Total current accumulated depreciation related to the above IT dollars.Planned 2002 IT depreciation expense.Please note  you should only be reflecting dollars for IT assets that are on your respective BU s books.  Planned  02 IT depreciation should just reflect depreciation expense from those assets.  IT assets on ENW s books will be picked up by ENW Fin Ops.  Depreciation recognized on ENW s books and then allocated to other BU s will be reflected as ENW depreciation and should NOT be reflected in any other BU for purposes of this analysis.Whalley would like to see this information tomorrow.  Therefore  please let me know if your respective area cannot provide the information to me by noon tomorrow (10/16).I m at X3-5439 if you have any questions.Thanks Mike

We asked the FERC to take immediate action giving specific guidance on the essential aspects of an RTO structure based on the SE mediation report by the ALJ (governance  stakeholder process and congestion management using LMP).  After such guidance we suggested that the order require a collaborative process of all parties to work out the details of an RTO to be fully operational by December 15  2002.Enron s request goes further than any of those recently filed at FERC by other parties which ask for the MW to be sent to mediation (much like the SE and NE proceedings).  Enron s pleading argues that the ARTO and MISO TOs and stakeholders already had a mediation-type process which resulted in a settlement.  Enron had been the only party to oppose the settlement on the basis that two MW RTOs would not work out the seams agreements sufficiently to make a single MW market.  The filings show in fact that the "compatible" protocols and procedures promised by the settlement have not succeeded in their attempts.  The amorphous agreements to agree by the two RTOs are still just that  lacking the detail necessary to assure a seamless MW market.The FERC has indicated that it will issue a rehearing order in the Alliance RTO proceeding by November.  It is possible that they will also act on the above pleading in that order.

opinionjournal@wsj.com,don.baughman@enron.com,X-FileName: don baughman 6-25-02.PST  From http://OpinionJournal.comBest of the Web Today - January 14  2002By JAMES TARANTO A Significant Political Opportunity   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40691-2002Jan13.htmlQuoted in today s Washington Post  an unnamed "key Democratic strategist" has this to say about the Enron fiasco: "Democrats are very excited about this because this gives us a hook to bring this guy [President Bush] some accountability  plus there s no way it s not going to be a distraction for them. Privately  Democrats are almost unanimous in seeing this as a significant political opportunity. But we don t want to blow it."Pardon us for spoiling the party  but there is a war on. It s not the most opportune of times to distract the president with a phony political scandal. Of course it s another matter if investigations turn up evidence of genuine wrongdoing by government officials  but if this strategist is to be believed  Democrats are happy to proceed in the absence of any such evidence.And what exactly is the Bush administration alleged to have done? Here s Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware  on yesterday s " Meet the Press  http://msnbc.com/news/686453.asp ": "If there was any  any involvement because of the incredible help the Bush campaign got from Enron here  it will be--I don t know that there has been--but it will be devastating." But on "Fox News Sunday " Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut echoed Rep. Henry Waxman  who  as we  noted Friday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718   said it was a scandal that the administration refused to give Enron special treatment. Fox doesn t have a transcript on its Web site  so here s a  CNN report  http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/01/13/enron/index.html :*** QUOTE ***[Treasury Secretary Paul] O Neill  a guest on "Fox News Sunday " defended the government s decision not to intervene as Enron s stock price collapsed. Lieberman called O Neill s comments "outrageous" and promised an aggressive investigation of Enron s collapse.*** END QUOTE ***Before the Democrats start throwing around accusations  shouldn t they at least agree on what would constitute a scandal?The President and the Pretzel  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41179-2002Jan14.htmlHere s an early nominee for  bottom news story  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001644#bottom  of 2002: President Bush was watching the Miami-Baltimore playoff game yesterday when  as Press Secretary Ari Fleischer explains  "he was eating a pretzel  and he said it felt like it did not go down right. He fainted. He woke up what he believes were a few seconds later." He scraped his cheek when he fell. The White House physician checked him out  and he s fine. The Dolphins  on the other hand  choked  losing to the Ravens 20-3.Picking Up the Pieces  http://www.observer.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0 1501 631972 00.html"American special forces searching the Tora Bora cave complex in eastern Afghanistan are collecting dismembered fingers and human organ tissue in an attempt to establish whether Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were killed during last year s massive assault on the caves " reports London s Observer. The paper quotes an unnamed "intelligence source" as saying: "Just before the complex fell  I got a call from a friend involved in the operation. He told me:  We really think we ve got him. It s only a matter of time.  All the information we had at that time suggests he must be dead."The paper s sources say their "most likely hypothesis" is that Osama has met Allah. The  Christian Science Monitor  http://csmonitor.com/2002/0114/p1s2-wosc.html   however  says that Afghan intelligence officials think he s in Pakistan.How Omar Got Away  http://www.msnbc.com/news/686895.aspNewsweek interviews Qari Saheb  who served as Mullah Mohammad Omar s personal driver  who explains how the top Talib escaped:*** QUOTE ***Saheb was with Omar at his compound in Kandahar last Oct. 7 when the first American bombs began to fall. According to Saheb  Omar initially spurned advisers who begged him to flee to safety. "Even if Bush shows up at my door  I will not leave " said Omar. His advisers told him that the Americans would use chemical weapons. Omar brandished a gas mask  but the aides warned him that the masks were good only for an hour. Knowing that the Americans would target his SUV  aides ushered Omar into a rickshaw. Pulled into the center of town  Omar shifted to a mud-covered truck and disappeared. He spent the next several days moving from house to house  sleeping in basements.*** END QUOTE ***Agence France-Presse  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/140102/dlame31.asp  reports that "influential Pashtuns " including members of the interim Afghan government  are helping Omar evade arrest.Osama s Unfunniest Home Videos--I  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1758000/1758422.stmA gun-toting toddler is among the stars of a new al Qaeda video obtained in Afghanistan and aired by the  Australian Broadcasting Corp.  http://abc.net.au/ra/newstories/RANewsStories_457534.htm  The BBC describes the scene:*** QUOTE ***One sequence shows a small boy--aged about two--holding a gun. A man s voice asks him in Arabic why he is carrying a gun. Is it to kill infidels  the voice inquires.*** END QUOTE ***The video also shows "fighters storming a building and taking hostages  barking commands at them in English and shooting one captive dead" and "an apparent assassination attack on a motorcade."Osama s Unfunniest Home Videos--II  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34200-2002Jan11.htmlThe Washington Post has details of what we assume was another tape  released by the Singapore government in the wake of the recent terror bust there:*** QUOTE ***The tape . . . features a man describing how explosives could be carried on a bicycle without arousing suspicion. The man--identified as Hashim bin Abas  40  a "service engineer"--was among 15 suspected Islamic militants taken into custody in Singapore last month. . . .According to the Singapore ministry [of home affairs]  the alleged terrorist cell had two plans "ready for activation." One apparently involved blowing up the shuttle bus that carries U.S. military personnel between a naval base used by visiting warships and a train station  a scenario suggested in the videotape  which appears to have been made for reconnaissance purposes.The tape depicts the station from various angles  then focuses on a bicycle bay located beneath the north end of the station and train tracks. Bicycles are shown with cargo boxes mounted in the back.*** END QUOTE ***The  Straits Times  http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0 1870 95812 00.html  reports that the Muslim Student Society at the National University of Singapore is applauding the arrests. "It is a very sad state of affairs that even Singapore is not free of the global terror network that is seeding chaos throughout the world " Mohamed Nawab Mohamed Osman  the group s head  tells the paper.Radio Silence  http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/8661.htmAbdallah Higazy  a 30-year-old Egyptian man  has been charged with perjury in an odd case that could mean nothing--or a great deal. According to authorities  Higazy  a computer-science student at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn  checked into the Millenium [sic] Hilton  a luxury hotel across the street from the World Trade Center  Aug. 27 and said he planned to stay until Sept. 25. Reports the New York Post:*** QUOTE ***On Sept. 11  he was in the hotel room and immediately evacuated without his belongings after the attacks. . . . When hotel security eventually began clearing the rooms of personal belongings in October  an employee opened the safe in Higazy s room and found [a] pilot-to-pilot radio  a Koran  and a medallion.The radio can be used by pilots in the air to communicate with each other or someone on the ground could use it to talk to pilots in flight. It could also be used to monitor pilots  conversations from the ground.Higazy tried to retrieve his things in December  when FBI agents appeared and asked him about the radio. Although he admitted having some knowledge of communications equipment from being in the Egyptian Air Corps branch of that nation s army  the suspect denied the radio was his and said he d never seen it before  authorities charge.*** END QUOTE ***The Queen s Flight  http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0 6903 631967 00.htmlRemember Abu Qatada  the  terrorist welfare queen  Brits%20lose%20track%20of%20terrorist%20welfare%20queen%20(S.E.%20Brenner):%20http://opinionjournal.com/best/queen  known as Osama bin Laden s "Egyptian ambassador" who lost his bid to collect &pound;213 in benefits from the British government?

You heard it here first.  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/tvaradarajan/?id=95001172To Protect the Guilty  http://headlines.sify.com/476news2.htmlTehreek-i-Jafria Pakistan  an extremist political party banned by Gen. Pervez Musharraf  is changing its name to Millat-e-Jafria Pakistan  Agence France-Presse reports. The Taliban Wing   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64452-2002Jan4.htmlA recent Washington Post article describes how Sayed Abdullah was brutalized by the Taliban  who falsely suspected he was Christian because he had two Bibles--one in English and one in the Dari language--in his personal library:*** QUOTE ***Several guards came in and forced Sayed face down on the table. They tied his hands and feet to its legs. Then they beat him with sticks and heavy plastic ropes  punching  pounding  whipping. Sayed says he endured two or three hours of it before he passed out. . . .The Taliban guards again tied him on the table. This time  they poured water on his feet  then wound electrical wires around both of his big toes. The wires were attached to an old Soviet military field telephone. The guards turned the telephone s crank  sending a searing electrical current into Sayed s feet. It went on for more than an hour. He felt as if some powerful force was lifting him high off the table  then slamming him down again  over and over.*** END QUOTE ***There s more  but this gives a flavor of Abdullah s five-month ordeal. In Saturday s New York Times (link requires registration)  columnist  Bill Keller  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/opinion/12KELL.html  blasts Sens. Phil Gramm  Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond  who  he says  "have in common the fact that they harnessed their collective century of seniority to the Taliban wing of the American right." You know  the guys who torture people they suspect of being Christians.Yasser  That s the Ticket  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/jtaranto/?id=95001721We got such an overwhelming number of responses to  Friday s invitation  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718#explain  to explain the Palestinian arms shipment that we had to put them in a separate article. Click on the headline of this item to read it.High Bias  http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0112/18/asb.00.htmlAndrew Sullivan  http://andrewsullivan.com/  has been doing a brilliant job rebutting liberal media folks who pooh-pooh Bernard Goldberg s best-selling book  " Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News  http://www.bennettandcurran.com/cgi-bin/Shopper.exe?preadd=action&key=0895261901 ." We particularly like this exchange  which Sullivan found in the Dec. 18 transcript of CNN s "Newsnight With Aaron Brown":*** QUOTE ***Brown: Some conservatives jumped on [John] Walker  saying he is a product of cultural liberalism--the California kind--helping to turn an impressionable kid against his own country.Joining us from Salinas  California  one of those conservatives  Shelby Steele of the Hoover Institution. Mr. Steele wrote a provocative article the other day in  The Wall Street Journal  http://opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001578 --a column in the Journal.And here in New York  a columnist who thinks Mr. Steele is making an awfully broad generalization. Richard Cohen of the Washington Post. It s nice to have both of you here. Mr. Steele.Steele: First of all  let me interrupt you just a minute.Brown: OK.Steele: Is Richard Cohen a liberal?Brown: Yeah  Richard Cohen s a liberal. I think he would say that  wouldn t he? . . .Cohen: On this issue.Brown: On this issue. OK. Everyone is now branded  I guess.Steele: OK. Great.Brown: Now let me try . . .Steele: If I m going to be  everybody is going to be.*** END QUOTE ***Of course no one suggests Brown is deliberately being unfair  but this does seem to be an indisputable example of the kind of unthinking bias about which Goldberg writes.Let It Slide?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40795-2002Jan13.htmlSpeaking of the Marin mujahid  the Washington Post has another long profile of him that adds even more details about his liberal upbringing. A few tidbits: When the Lindhs (Walker s father s name) lived in ultraliberal Takoma Park  Md.  before moving to Marin County  Calif.  Walker s mother became "something of a local activist. Neighbors recall her waging a zealous campaign to have a metal slide at a local playground removed  saying it was too dangerous for children." Yemen  apparently  was not too dangerous for children.In her activism  Walker s mother shamefully exploited her young daughter:*** QUOTE ***Marilyn Walker took their 9-year-old daughter  Naomi  to a small local demonstration denouncing U.S. bombing raids over Iraq. The Marin Independent Journal ran a photo of the girl standing amid a few dozen protesters waving signs at passing traffic that read  "Don t Kill Iraqi Kids."*** END QUOTE ***Our favorite detail from the story  though  is its description of Walker s high school  which "had a rare teaching philosophy: It held no classes."Stupidity Watch  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/opinion/L12TERR.html In a letter to the editor of the New York Times (link requires registration)  one John E. Colbert of Chicago opines: "In searching for the next targets  the United States should consider other terrorists closer to home: thousands of deaths occur each year from drunken driving  gun violence and lack of health care--to name just a few culprits that terrorize and kill Americans." Yeah  John  let s drop a few bombs on lack of health care.Wobegon in Albany  http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyKey=74614We can t help but admire the cruelty of the Albany (N.Y.) Times Union s editors  who printed a letter from one Charles Heinze that concludes as follows:*** QUOTE ***If we are looking for a place to start  let s start with what the average hourly pay is in America and see to it that this is the minimum wage for all full-time employees.And before you say it can t be done  look at what welfare  and other public assistance including health care and having the thousands of not-for-profits cost us each year.*** END QUOTE ***A tip of the hat to whoever wrote the headline: "All Should Be Paid at Least the Average U.S. Salary." That "at least" is a stroke of genius.Then and Mao  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/13/wmao13.xmlLondon s Daily Telegraph reports on a "model Chinese village devoted to Maoist ideals":*** QUOTE ***Hoardings urge workers to "Put Mao Tse-tung thought in command of everything" and a deafening public address system regularly broadcasts rousing communist anthems. . . . Apartments come in only two sizes. Residents are bound by strict rules. The approval of a Communist Party committee is required for all marriages. A mass wedding is held once a year on New Year s Day. After childbirth women are sterilised. Wrongdoers are paraded through the village with their heads shaved. The village has acquired cult status among those who still pine for the certainties of the Mao era.*** END QUOTE ***Alas  it s being razed to make way for a business park designed to attract foreign investors.The Son Also SetsSeveral readers wrote to inquire about our  Friday item  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718#nimitz  on the curious death notice for Rear Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and his wife. No  this wasn t the Adm. Chester Nimitz who led the Pacific fleet during World War II; he died in 1966. It was his son.

Sorry  it s still cold. In fact  if you think it s gotten colder  you re not crazy. "Scientists working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of east Antarctica have found temperatures dropping at a rate of 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit per decade since 1986  and have observed similar downward trends across the continent since 1978.""I d be very careful with this " Michael Oppenheimer  chief scientist for  Environmental Defense  http://environmentaldefense.org/   tells the Washington Post. "My general view has been that there s simply not enough data to make a broad statement about all of Antarctica." But we can make broad statements about the whole world?Next headline to watch for: "Homeless Antarcticans Hit Hardest by Cooling Trend."A Drink You Can Eat  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20020111/od/brew_dc_2.htmlReuters reports a South Korean brewer has come up with "chewable liquor"--"a gelatin form of its popular Paeksaejoo rice wine." This is supposed to be an innovation  but haven t the folks at Reuters heard of  Jell-O shots  http://www.outofthefryingpan.com/recipes/jello.shots.shtml ?Our Ever-Expanding Rights  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/49699_judo07.shtmlLast month the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported on one of the silliest lawsuits we ve ever heard of. Fourteen-year-old judo champion Leilani Akiyama went to court  claiming that the practice of bowing before a judo match violated her rights:*** QUOTE ***Bowing in a private club is one thing  but the practice should not be mandatory in a public facility for a tournament  said Akiyama s attorney  Mark Fleming.Bowing "takes away critical thinking " said John Holm  Akiyama s stepfather and judo instructor. "You think you re giving respect  but it s really a submissive act."Holm  who teaches 35 students at his judo club in Renton  says the bowing largely stems from customs of Shinto  an ancient religion indigenous to Japan. Shinto is based on custom  reverence for ancestral traditions  and living and acting according to the guidance of the gods.Akiyama s mother  Mariko  a native of Japan  is Buddhist and doesn t want her children to be forced to practice Shinto rituals  Holm said.He also said some Muslim and Christian students in his class have the skills and would like to compete in regional and national competitions but will not because it offends their beliefs."Bowing is a prayer act  and Muslims can only pray to Allah " Holm said. "It s just unfair."*** END QUOTE ***Judge Robert Lasnik should take a bow; last week  in a show of good sense  he ruled against Akiyama.(Elizabeth Crowley helps compile Best of the Web Today.

psagman@murrayinc.net,klay@enron.com,PATRICK SAGMAN601 Old Hickory Blvd   61Brentwood  TN 37027psagman@murrayinc.netTo Mr. Ken Lay I m writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds  such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH  that benefit the company s employees  who lost their retirement savings  and provide relief to low-income consumers in California  who can t afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.Indeed  while you netted well over a $100 million  many of Enron s employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result  there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company s employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron s underhanded dealings.Sincerely PATRICK SAGMAN
kenneth.booi@mirant.com,kenneth.lay@enron.com,Dear Dr. Lay:As a stockholder  I am as upset as you  most Enron employees and otherco-shareholders are given Enron s recent performance due to questionablemanagement by scrupulous officers at Enron.As an ex-employee  I have seen many signs of a major collapse  given thefact that Enron s values (such as Respect  Integrity  Communicatons andExcellence) were simply not followed by Enron s officers and senior membersof management.  There are examples  such as in Panama  Palestine  and theDominican Republic.  One bad deal after the other with questionableeconomics and accounting to make each deal look good for the personalbenefit of one individual in charge.It is about time that you get rid of these individuals and bring Enron backto what you have built over the years to be a successful company.Regards ken booi
rtunstall@csis.org,Undisclosed-Recipient,This message contains the text of Sidney Weintraub s Issues in International Political Economy for the month of October. This month  Dr. Weintraub focuses on the argument that the treatment for the cause of the terrorist attacks lies in reducing poverty. To go directly to the web version  click on:http://www.csis.org/simonchair/issues200110.htmFor further information  please contact Rebecca Tunstall at 202-775-3123.ISSUES IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMYOctober 2001  Number 22THE TERRORIST ATTACK: TREATING THE CAUSESSidney WeintraubWe have been hearing much since September 11 that the United States  to avoid future terrorist attacks  must treat the causes. Which causes? Should the treatment deal with reversing the terrorists  hatred for the United States  eliminating anti-Jewish sentiment  correcting the lack of freedom in most Middle-Eastern countries  refighting the Kosovo war and getting some Americans killed  making too many or too few charges against foreign human rights violations  eliminating homosexuality and civil liberties in the United States (as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson seem to believe)  altering the capitalist system that prevails in the developed countries  changing the U.S. lifestyles that so infuriate Muslim zealots  reducing poverty?No shortage of "causes " some outrageous  others idiosyncratic  and some even with a sense of legitimacy  have been put forward that should be treated. The monthly commentaries in this issues series deal with political economy and I will stick (mostly) to the last and focus on poverty. However  this must be prefaced with a caveat. I find it impossible that anyone can seriously believe that because there is much poverty in the Middle East  terrorists who are not themselves poor concluded that the corrective was to attack the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon and kill thousands of innocent people.I am focusing on poverty because it is a global scourge and we would have a better world if poverty could be reduced drastically. One consequence of the events on September 11 will be to sharply increase poverty because of the ripple effects on developing countries from the economic troubles of the United States and other industrial countries. Markets for the goods and services of developing countries will shrink  as will investment in them. When the economies of rich countries decline  the suffering from the fallout is usually greater in poor countries. This  for better or worse  is part of globalism.Many implicitly assume that the reduction of poverty has been neglected up until now. This is not true. What is correct  however  is that the world has not been overwhelmingly effective in dealing with the problem. The number of people who live below the poverty line is now about 1.3 billion. This is an enormous figure  even though the proportion of the world s population living in poverty has declined more in the past 50 years than in the previous 500 years. The absolute number  however  has risen.Poverty is not an independent manifestation isolated from development strategies and politics within countries  but part and parcel of the bigger picture. I have not understood the motivations of the protesters who show up to disrupt meetings of international development and trade organizations because precisely these institutions have taken the lead to reduce poverty. Poverty did not begin with globalization. The proportion of people living in poverty has not increased because globalization has made communications and financial transfers more efficient than ever before. If anything  globalization is an opportunity to reduce levels of poverty because linkages between developed and developing countries are now so intense.Poverty reduction clearly goes hand-in-hand with economic growth. Overall economic growth is insufficient to reduce poverty  but it is the essential ingredient. Redistribution without growth merely rearranges the scenery  but does not get at the core of the problem. Poverty-reduction policy  therefore  must be an ingredient of development policy. And that is the rub; no simple  sure-fire formula exists for converting a stagnant  low-income country into a vibrant one with a growing economy.Development is a slow  slogging  arduous process that must deal with big-picture matters  such as macroeconomic policy  and microeconomic issues of industrial and agricultural development and the building of solid institutions. Education must be a priority  and this cannot be accomplished in one decade or one generation. Infant mortality is higher and life expectancy is lower in developing countries because of inadequate health care. Countries need roads to bring goods to market  equity in land tenure  ports  an adequate and safe water supply  and the infrastructure that makes development possible. Poverty reduction  if all of these needs are met  must then be a conscious part of government programs  which is why bumper-sticker slogans like "Reduce Poverty" are fatuous. By all means  let us work to reduce poverty  but the issue must be treated more seriously than a politician s or an editorialist s spin might suggest.The history of today s developed countries  as widely documented  is that poverty actually increased during the early years of the development process. Investments during the early days of the growth process tended to direct resources to immediately productive activities and only after the cumulative effects of these development accomplishments reached a pivotal point did poverty and inequality decline. Thus one may make a case for directing more resources to developing countries  but they must be part of a viable development program. And  yes  the United States has not in recent years been a generous aid donor in relation to the U.S. gross domestic product. Politicians say that foreign aid is not popular because it helps foreigners. Yes  it does  but what is wrong with that?The discussion of poverty reduction can be brought specifically to the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Most people in those regions  which seem to be the cradle of the terrorism movement  live in poverty. Not a single country in the Middle East  save Israel  has a democratic government. Population growth rates are high and this adds to the costs of development. Yet  the priorities of dictatorial leaders  whether religious or otherwise  are not economics-or reducing poverty-but a host of other issues  from religious fanaticism to political dominance to a hatred of neighbors.Is this situation mainly the fault of the United States? Does the existence of Israel impoverish its Arab enemies? The answer to both questions is  of course  no. Has the United States made errors in the ways it has interacted with countries in the Middle East? Has Israel? Yes  both countries have. But to then leap from this to the assertion that the attacks were justified  that the United States got what it deserved  is insane. Has the United States provided benefits and favors to countries in the Middle East? The answer is surely yes  more so than any other country.Countries make their own development policies. Unless a country makes a development policy its own  the reality that aid will accomplish little has long been a truism among development-assistance practitioners. Donor countries and agencies can give advice and provide technical and financial resources  but they cannot impose programs that national leaders do not want  a lesson that has been learned repeatedly. Aid donors cannot eliminate corruption; leaders of countries must do that. The donors cannot insist that dictatorial regimes be transformed into democracies; they can withhold aid or they can grant it and hope that some start at development will lead to more satisfactory regimes. If economic development and the installation of democracy are unimportant in the agendas of foreign leaders  neither the United States nor other donors have much power to alter the situation.To return to where this commentary began  poverty is a deep-seated plague  one that the world must deal with on moral and practical grounds. However  it is impossible to will away poverty; this takes consistent dedication. Poverty has been reduced sharply in some countries because their leaders and priorities of governance sincerely sought economic growth and poverty reduction. The number of poor has been reduced as a proportion of world population because of the economic system put into effect after World War II. However  the job is far from accomplished and deserves a sustained effort to do better in the future.Issues in International Political Economy is produced by the William E.

Because we all have very busy lives andfind it impossible to confirm too far in advance  I will wait closer to eachgame before distributing tickets.  Also  Ken s schedule is a moving targetand it would make it much easier for him to squeeze in at least one gamethis year  if we could do it on shorter notice.  Our eight basketball seatsare amazing and the tickets are a hot item  so hopefully everyone will tryto make this work and have fun doing it.I will wait at least seven days before each game to distribute the tickets.If you have any interest in pre-selecting certain games that you definitelywant to attend  please advise me and I will put your name on the list withan * next to it.  Additionally  if you think you know your schedule andwould like to be considered in the ticket distribution for certain games  Iwill put your name on the list with a ? next to your name.  Once your nameis on the list and as each game gets closer  I would appreciate it if youwould contact me ASAP when you find out that you are unable to attend.Everyone has said that they want to be fair and rotate  so that each familymember has a shot at attending a game and getting both kinds of tickets.Hopefully  we can all work it out.  However  in the event that we have morerequests than tickets for the same game  and we are unable to settle it  Iwill have Barb pull names out of a hat.  Once you confirm your attendance tickets can be put in an envelope with your name on them and sent down tothe doorman at the Huntingdon for you to pick up.For any games where our immediate family is not able to use the tickets they will be distributed to other lucky recipients in a rotating order.  Iwill have Barb draw your names and ours out of a hat to create the rotation.If you have other family members or someone special that you would like tooffer tickets to  let me know.  I can either contact you and have youcontact them or you can give me their names and contact information and Barbwill contact them directly  as you wish.In the event that I am traveling or cannot be reached  please contact Barbas she will be copied in on all current schedules and have access to thetickets.

For instance  former Senator Bradley  and his wife  may beexpected to draw $7 900 000  with Mrs.. Bradley drawing $275 000 duringthe last year of her life. This is calculated on an average life spanfor each. This would be well and good  except that they paid nothing inon any kind of retirement  and neither does any other Senator orCongressman.This fineretirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money. While wewho pay for it all  draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security.Imagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan sodesirable that people would have extra deducted so that they couldincrease their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan thatworks so well  that  Railroad employees  Postal Workers  and others whoaren t in it  would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Securitycould be  if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk theGolden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen and put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fastthey fix it. If enough people receive this  maybe one or some of themalong the way   might be able to help.How many can YOU send it to ??William R.

He is now chairman of the AIPCertification and Accreditation Council.The energy industry  though cautious about utilizing the web  is scramblingto take advantage of this next big thing.  Recently  several top companieshave taken the plunge to hire Internet professionals to develop their ownvirtual training programs.Equiva Services LLC  a joint venture company formed by Texaco Inc.  ShellOil Company and Saudi Refining  Inc  ABB Vetco Gray  and Columbia GulfTransmission Company  have all recently jumped on the e-learning bandwagon.All three companies have created web-based platforms or e-commerce hubs tha=tenable employees to quickly and conveniently get necessary training frompre-selected suppliers.=01&This type of innovative application of information technology will help= usto work smarter and faster for our internal clients =018 said Mari Duarte senior human resources generalist for ABB Vetco Gray.  =01&We expect to low=ercosts and improve efficiency by reducing the time of administrativetransactions related to registration and by improving reporting ofinformation related to training activities to management.=018For the energy industry  E-learning can involve both the automation oftraining management systems as well as the transmission and delivery oflearning to individuals through use of the Internet.  Through thistechnology  training information previously available through classroominstruction can be delivered directly to employees=01  desktops in differen=tforms  ranging from basic presentation-style courses to highly interactivecourses with digitized video transmissions and on-line discussions.=01&E-learning can encompass training employees and it can be used to shareimportant knowledge across the organization and with outside businesspartners =018 said Dennis McMullin  energy industry consultant at Proxicom = aleading Internet consulting firm in Houston  Texas.  McMullin says that mor=ecompanies are increasing the amount of training they offer online to helpemployees stay current on market trends and personal skills.  =01&There can= bea significant cost savings involved in using technology for learning  but acompany=01 s success ultimately depends on how effectively it can bring thetechnology into the organization and how well they use it.=018E-learning technology can also ease the administrative burden on anorganization=01 s human resources department and lower the per-unit cost oftraining employees.  Additionally  management has the ability to betteranalyze training needs and how to best deploy the information.  =01&Web-bas=edtraining is extremely flexible and offers employees convenience inscheduling courses when they need and want them =018 said McMullin.  =01&It= alsoallows them the opportunity to go back and revisit course material if theneed a refresher or a resource.  It is a self-teaching method that letsindividuals learn at their own pace and based on their own needs."Internet companies such as VerticalNet  Inc. in Horsham  PA  offer companie=sthe ability to manage training programs through an Internet interface thatdirectly links the company with training suppliers.  Taken one stop further= VerticalNet=01 s =01&Training Intelligence Portals=018 enable companies to =centralizetheir personnel training programs and literally outsource administration an=dother back-office transactions such as invoice management  utilizationreporting  course evaluation and quality assurance.According to Walter Rogers  VerticalNet=01 s eBusiness training services se=niordirector and general manager  the energy industry is becoming moreaggressive in moving from office administration and classroom learning toweb-based technology for training.  =01&We=01 re seeing a lot more demand f=rom theenergy sector for e-learning technology =018 said Rogers  whose firm iscurrently working with several large energy companies.  =01&We=01 ve found =thatthe energy industry doesn=01 t typically lead the way in the use of technol=ogy.It tends to want to see it working and proven in other areas before they tr=yit.  But now they are getting more involved.  Since the industry is drivento reduce operating costs  it finds this technology to be very costeffective.=018In addition to hiring Internet experts to develop and manage a trainingsite  Dennis McMullin points out that there is a large variety of existingtraining opportunities for on-line learning.  =01&Most of the technologycompanies offer on-line training for technical products  while numerous websites offer free information and opportunities for e-learning =018 he said.In the end  however  McMullin believes that acceptance of the Internet ismore than a technological issue for many companies  rather it requires acultural adjustment.  =01&It really is an issue of adjusting the companyculture to accept and benefit from Internet technology.  It requirescompanies to be more open and less fearful of sharing information.  Energycompanies could really benefit from effective use of the Internet if theyuse it as a median to share more knowledge throughout their organizationsand with suppliers.=018NEWS ROUND-UPDUKE SOLUTIONS USING B2B MARKETPLACE TO REDUCE CLIENT BILLS<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml>#news1TS HUB: A NEW OFFERING FROM FT ENERGY <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news2>GE POWER SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES OFFER TO ACQUIRE SMALLWORLD PLC<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news3>OPENLINK EXPANDS EUROPEAN OPERATIONS<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news4>PARKER DRILLING CONSIDERS INTERNET OPPORTUNITIES<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news5>POWERTRUST.COM APPOINTS CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news6>******************************************************AdvertisementE-BUSINESS FOR ENERGY ASIA PACIFICOctober 7-9  2000  SingaporeLearn how the e-business explosion is changing the Asian Pacific energysectorhttp://www.eyeforenergy.com/asia-pacificINTRANET AND PORTAL STRATEGIES FOR ENERGYOctober 17-19  2000  Houston  TXThe premier annual US forum on internal e-business strategies for the entir=eenergy industry<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/ipse>*******************************************************CASE STUDYSpare plant parts become manageable with Sparesfinder.comOne of the Internet=01 s most powerful features is its ability to makeinformation instantly available that once was virtually impossible to get.That=01 s exactly the power behind sparesFinder.com  an Internet service th=atallows chemical  petroleum and power companies to manage their owninventories of factory parts and search the inventories of other companiesaround the globe for needed replacements.Click here for full article:<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#case1>CASE STUDYDeregulation and the ConsumerConventional wisdom tells us to =01&build it and they will come.=018 With o=ver$300 billion at stake in the U.S. energy market alone  it is not surprisingthat the young-guns of the Internet world are homing in on the traditionallegacy laden utilities as deregulation tears away at their regionalmonopolies.Click here for full article:<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#case2>RELATED INDUSTRY FEATURES<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related>REDMETEOR.COM CHOOSE SAGAVISTA FOR BACKEND INTEGRATION SOLUTION <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related1>TRADIANT TEAMS WITH ANDERSEN CONSULTING TO BRING THE POWER OF THE WEB TOGLOBAL SHIPPING INDUSTRY<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related2>*******************************************************To subscribe for the e-commerce for energy briefingEmail   : energynews-subscribe-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com<mailto:energynews-subscribe-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com>To unsubscribe Email  energynews-signoff-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com<mailto:energynews-signoff-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com>To comment on this newsletter or add your own content pleaseEmail Michelle at ecenergy@firstconf.com******************************************************e-business for energy briefingWednesday September 6 2000Issue 10*******************************************************Disclaimer - First Conferences and its agents used their best efforts incollecting and preparing the information published herein.

During the weekend of October 6 and 7  2001 the Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating all production users off the current hardware (Solar) that houses their home and application directories (no production databases are effected) to new hardware.  This migration requires a total system outage of approximately 4 hours.  The outage will occur Friday night - Saturday morning between the hours of Midnight to 4:00 AM.  All users will need to be logged off during this time period.  If this is not possible  contact Adam DeRidder (x3-1428) or Carlos Uribe (x5-8179) as soon as possible. In order to validate the migration  production users need to test access to their home directories and applications on Saturday  October 7 and Sunday  October 8  2001. As part of the migration plan  the Storage Team needs volunteers from the production community to test the new environment.  The test will only require approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.  Adam DeRidder and Carlos Uribe have setup a test lab on the 34th floor for this purpose.  Contact Adam to setup a time.  Your involvement will help make this a successful migration. A list of contacts will be made available on Thursday  October 5  2001.  Please use this list to report issues and check the status of the migration.Bob AmbrocikEnterprise Storage TeamEB 3429Fx5-4577bob.ambrocik@enron.com

eric@jensenmotorsport.com,jeff.skilling@enron.com,If you guys watched the Monaco Grand Prix this past Sunday...  perhaps you saw the fellow from the Ferrari team who went on the podium to  receive the winner s trophy from Prince Ranier? That was my good friend Luca Baldisserri  who is the chief  engineer for Ferrari and won almost everything these past few years with his  driver Michael Schumacher...Luca is likely the best car engineer in the world   and is interested to join me in the future as a partner to operate a team in the  U.S. based CART "IndyCar" series... I invited you both as our sport requires strong corporate  partners to function... and thought you may have interest with knowledge that  you would be working with some of the best people in the world... which would  make it reasonable to achieve a very positive return on any corporate  investment. Please feel welcome to keep in touch... and to join us  for a race this summer if you wish. Best to youEric Jensen407.925.7489 - luca+eric-cgp98.JPG

sean.crandall@enron.com,amy.fitzpatrick@enron.com,X-FileName: On August 16  2001  Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year.  The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for  and for the most part  Enron s internal systems did not track the information in the format requested.  Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money  it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together  even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible  and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive.  Utilizing Cara s comprehensive  and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems  we were able to accomplish this task.  There were many instances where we hit a "brick wall".  Specifically  it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset  although it was imperative we do so.  Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.As a result of her efforts  we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC  and subsequently for our FERC filing.

There are conflicting reports that Houston  through the estate  will handle updating scheduling in Enpower or that the scheduling group should be updating Enpower accordingly.What I am hoping for is that by whatever communications means necessary we can come to a final action plan on how to clean this and get Enpower up to date as quickly and as accurately as possible.Thanks John

For example PSEI PGE  and BPAT are all TPs offering Johnday-COB service.  There could be atransaction that would utilize a reservation with each provider and it wouldbe most convenient to stack all that information in one tag.Andy suggests the WSCC might want to come-up with an alternative  such asone administrator TP for the whole path.  Sounds like an RTO.  So  if we have a choice  we prefer the ability to stack providers on a tag -yes???Number 2 - the transmissionless interchange.  I have been suggesting that wewill continue on with our practice just using the TP that belongs to source(or sink) as stated in BP #11.  Andy doesn t think that ll fly in 1.7.  Whatreally concerns me is his statement that "Under 1.7  a CA cannot existwithout a parent TP."  Funny  I always looked at it the other way around.  Idon t know what that means to SCL  CHPD  and other CAs who  up till now have not registered as TPs.My example was a MIDC CA to CA transaction that has historically been at thebus without transmission.  The participants have traditionally used theirinterchange accounting systems to record these deals as scheduledinterchange with another CA.  Transmission was not taken into considerationsince the participants had owned and/or contract rights from MIDC to theirsystems.  In addition  it has been an easy way to path-it-out by sinking it then creating separate transaction source at the same place.I did feel that this issue shouldn t be brought to IS s attention - that wewould just work it out with our business practices.

Please give me a shout asap to discuss.  Having these sub-QSE s is bad for EPMI for the following reasons: (1) sub-QSE s are settled as stand-alone QSE s and thus  - EPMI gets smaller deadband limits for each sub-QSE  - Wind deviations could not be covered with % deadband of other schedules (wind would have to be setup as its own sub-QSE) (2) sub-QSE s significantly affect EPMI s ability to make profits by optimizing a portfolio of customers - EPMI is better off with one large QSE that it can share/balance among different schedules - Customers could request to be setup as a sub-QSE and it would be difficult for EPMI to optimize between customers and make profits.  We lose the  ability of having a black box where customers can not see how we optimize our portfolio.Thanks  - Mike---------------------- Forwarded by Mike Curry/HOU/ECT on 12/06/2000 09:29 AM ---------------------------"Moseley  Cheryl" <CMoseley@ercot.com> on 12/05/2000 08:32:41 PMTo: 1 Retail Users Group Ad Hoc Subcommittee <isonp@ercot.com>cc:  Subject: Proposed modification to PIP 108Attached is the proposed modification to PIP 108 Subordinate QSEs. - 108PIP sub-QSE.doc
truorange@aol.com,truorange@aol.com,Part 2The Bowl OutlookThe Longhorns  victory over the Aggies assured them a spot in a major bowlgame.It probably will be the Holiday Bowl in San Diego on against Pacific Coasttri-champion Oregon State  a very good 10-1 team.But it could be the Cotton Bowl for a third straight year against an SECpower.Let s look at the Big 12 Conference s bowl setup:1. Champion gets an automatic BCS bowl bid.a. If OU loses to Kansas State  the Sooners might get a BCS at-large bowlbid.2. Cotton Bowl  Jan. 1  payout $2.5 million  picks first after BCS bowls fi=llup. 10 a.m. Fox3. Holiday Bowl  Dec. 29  payout $1.9 million  gets second pick. 7:30 p.m.ESPN4. Alamo Bowl in San Antonio  Dec. 30  payout $1.2 million  comes  next. 7p.m. ESPN5. Insight.com Bowl in Tucson  Dec. 28  payout $750 000  gets the next bid.6:30 p.m. ESPN6. Independence Bowl in Shreveport  Dec. 30  payout $1.1 million. 7 p.m. ES=PN7. Galleryfurniture.com Bowl in Houston  Dec. 27  payout $750 000  comes la=stin the Big 12 pecking order. 7 p.m. ESPN-2The bowl bids won t go out until after the Big 12 title game this weekend but Kansas State probably needs to beat Oklahoma and win the automatic BCSberth to avoid falling to the lower-ranking bowls on the Big 12 list.K-State coach Bill Snyder is outstanding at winning games  but is not popul=arwith the bowl committee members because they feel he is a very reluctantparticipant in the pre-bowl festivities.So  the Wildcats probably won t affect the Longhorns  bowl hopes because th=eywill either beat Oklahoma and get an automatic BCS bid or the will lose tothe Sooners and be picked for a bowl bid after the Longhorns are already se=t.I think Oklahoma will get a BCS bid  even if the Sooners lose to K-StateSaturday. In that case  the Sooners wouldn t affect the Longhorns  bowlprospects either.That leaves the bowls with Big 12 ties looking like this after the BCS pick=s:Cotton Bowl - Nebraska (9-2) or Texas (9-2) vs. SEC team  probably Tennesse=e(8-3)Holiday Bowl - Texas (9-2) or Nebraska (9-2) vs. Oregon State (10-1)Alamo Bowl -  probably Texas A&M (7-4) or Kansas State (10-2) vs.Northwestern (8-3)Insight.com Bowl - A&M (7-4) or Kansas State (10-2) vs. Big East teamIndependence Bowl - Iowa State (8-3) vs. SEC teamGalleryfurniture.com Bowl - Texas Tech (7-5) vs. East Carolina (7-4)I m pulling for Texas to wind up in the Cotton Bowl game again because I dlike for the Horns to win their last game this season and I think Tennesseeis a better matchup for UT than Oregon State.FINAL BIG 12 STANDINGSSOUTHERN DIVISIONConference                  SeasonW   L   PF    PA     Pct.

He alsoscored on a 52-yard screen pass.Briles  last year s Class 4A Offensive Player of the year  completed 15 of =20passes for 230 yards and five touchdowns in a 61-6 romp past El Paso Ysleta=.Briles  who led Stephenville to the state 4A title last year  has thrown fo=rmore than 3 000 yards and 30 touchdown and has run for more than 800 yardsand 12 more TDs so far this season.Despite rumors galore to the contrary  both Benson and Briles said theyremain solidly committed to Texas.* * * *With 19 scholarships already committed  Texas will give only five to sevenmore this season. They could go as high as seven because they can countpunter Brian Bradford of Trinity Valley JC  who will enroll in January against last year.The best players still available who list the Longhorns No. 1 are LB Derric=kJohnson of Waco  DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia  Cal.; TE James Moses and DEJonathan Jackson  both of Galena Park North Shore; OL William Winston ofHouston Madison  safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple  athlete Quan Cosby of Ma=rtand DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC.Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players inthat group.DT Marquise Hill  6-6  300  5.0  of New Orleans De La Salle  and DE JustinTomerlin  6-7  260  of San Clemente  Cal.  are a couple of outstandingprospects who might visit Texas  but they are the longest of long shots rig=htnow.* * * *Top recruits who came to the A&M game were DTs Harris and Broussard  andLonghorn commitments OLs Jonathan Scott of Dallas Carter  Mike Garcia ofGalena Park and Terrance Young of Longview  LBs Yamil Lebron of KilleenEllison and Lance McFarland of Jefferson and RB Anthony Johnson of Jefferso=n.Two top junior prospects also were on hand =01) OL Kyle Thornton  6-5  300 = 5.2 of Dallas St. Mark s and WR Anthony Wright  6-3  200  4.5  of Klein Forest.Thornton is the younger brother of Longhorn freshman DE starter KalenThornton.Aggie Injury Excuses HollowThe Aggies players and coaches did a lost of post-game moaning about theirinjury problems.For the second straight year  Texas was missing starting QB Major Applewhit=eagainst A&M and the Horns also were down to a backup FB  Chad Stevens playing TE because all three scholarship TEs were injured.Two top DT reserves  Stevie Lee and Ryan Haywood  were lost for the season starting safety Lee Jackson and super DT Shaun Rogers have missed a lot oftime with injuries and redshirt freshman WR Artie Ellis  the guy who wascounted on to give those super freshmen some time to mature  had been outnearly all year with a sore shin.Then you have OL like Derrick Dockery and Antwan Kirk-Hughes who have beenbattle sickness and/or injuries all year.The point is that every team has injuries  and Texas has had more of themthis season than Texas A&M.Basketball Team 3-1Texas took a big early lead over  Indiana  Friday night and then held off aHoosier comeback for a 70-58 victory in the consolation game of the TivoPreseason NIT in New York City.The Longhorns (3-1) started three freshmen - James Thomas  Brandon Mouton a=ndRoyal Ivey - and used a stifling defense to take a 42-22 lead at halftime.Indiana (2-2) climbed back into the game and cut the lead to seven points a=t49-42  limiting Texas to just two baskets in the first 8:52 of the secondhalf.Then Thomas scored five straight points as Texas restored a comfortable lea=dwith a 13-0 run.Mouton and Maurice Evans opened the game with consecutive 3-pointers  and t=heTexas defensive pressure forced a lot of turnovers.Chis Owens had 12 points in the first half and led Texas with 15 points and14 rebounds.Texas had fallen to top-ranked Duke  95-69 Wednesday in the tourneysemifinals. Mouton led Texas with 18 points and Evans had 17.Baseball Team Adds FourBaseball coach Augie Garrido has signed third baseman Nic Crosta of Seattle= Wash  right-handed pitchers Chris Scofield of Fort Worth Nolan and DannyMuegge of Blinn JC and centerfielder Dustin Majewski of Blinn JC.to round o=utthe Longhorns  early signing class  for the 2001-02 campaign."With their potential both offensively and defensively  thse players aresolid additions to our early signing class that will  provide us with depth= "said Texas assistant coach and  recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon."Overall  we are very pleased  with the student-athletes we have signed forthe 2001-02 season."An honor student at Nolan Catholic High School  Scofield earned  All-Statehonors to go along with All-Area distinctions in 2000 as he  helped theVikings capture their district championship and finish  second in the statefinals.  He was also named his team s MVP last  season and was a teammate o=fcurrent Longhorn freshman pitcher Tim  McGough at Nolan.Crosta is a three-year varsity letterman  a three-time All-Seamount Leagueselection and two-time team MVP for Highline High School in Seattle  Wash.An honor student  Crosta posted a league-leading .551 batting average lastseason to go along with conference-best numbers in RBI (31) and home runs (=8)to win the Seamount League s Triple Crown and earn South County JournalAll-Area accolades.He was also named the Everett Wood Bat Classic MVP and to an All-Tournamentteam in Reno  Nev.  this past summer.Majewski hit .385 and blasted 16 homers at Blinn last season. Muegge playedlast season at McLennan JC in Waco  and is playing for Blinn this season. H=ehas a very good changeup and a fast ball in the 88-90 mph range.Reese Signs Top ProspectsTexas swimming coach Eddie Reese and diving coach Matt Scoggin have signedthree top recruits.They are swimmers Andrew Davidson of Father Ryan HS in Nashvill and RainerKendrick of Homewood HS in Birminghamm and diver Jonathan Linette of FortLauderdale  Fla.Davidson  a four-time high school All-American and 1999 SoutheasternConference Swimmer of the Year  is the defending Tennessee state champion i=nthe 100 butterfly and 100-yard backstroke.He also won the 1999 Junior National Championship in the 200 backstroke andqualified for the Olympic Trials in the 100 and 200 backstroke.Kendrick is a four-time All-State honoree and two-time South Eastern Swimme=rof the Year.At the 1999 American Short Course Championships  he placed first in both th=e200 and the 400  individual medley events  while also finishing runner-up i=nthe 100 freestyle and 200 butterfly.Linette won back-to-back Junior National Titles (1998 and 1999) on the10-meter platform  and also captured the bronze medal at the 2000 JuniorWorld Championships in the platform event. She posted a 12th-place finish(885.93) on the platform at the U. S. Olympic Trials."We are extremely pleased in this group " said Reese. "They are very talent=edand are definitely strong in each of their events  which will help solidifyand add versatility to our roster."Women s Golf Inks PairTexas women s golf coach Susan Watkins has signed Lisa Ferrero of Lodi  Cal=. and Perry Swenson of Charlotte  N. C.Ferrero won the 2000 U.S. Girls Junior Amateur title at the Pumpkin RidgeGolf Course in North Plains  Ore. last summer.The three-time AJGA All-American is currently ranked No. 15 in the Golfweek= sGirls Amateur Ratings  where she has posted 26 top-25 finishes.Swenson is ranked 58th in the Golfweek s Girls Amateur Ratings.

truorange@aol.com,truorange@aol.com,Recruiting RoundupThe big Longhorn recruiting weekend this year will be Dec. 15-17 and will b=ebuilt around the annual football banquet.Nearly all of the 19 recruits who have already committed to Texas have chos=enthat weekend to visit  and so have most of the players the Longhorns arestill recruiting.The list of players the Longhorns are still seriously recruiting iscontinuing to shrink.At this point  there are 10 recruits left on the board who (a) have offers =orwill get offers if they check out okay academically  and (b) are stronglyconsidering the Longhorns.They are DT Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison  LB Derrick Johnson of Waco  D=LKaelen Jakes of Valencia  Cal.; TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson  bot=hof Galena Park North Shore; OL Jamie Hightower of Jacksonville  OL WilliamWinston of Houston Madison  safety Dewayne Brandon of Temple  athlete QuanCosby of Mart and DT Paul Broussard of Blinn JC.Most of the remaining six or seven scholarships will go to the players inthat group.Johnson  Jakes  Moses  Jackson and Brandon all list Texas No. 1 at thispoint  and it is possible the Longhorns will get all five of them.Winston also says Texas is tops with him right now  but he also wants to lo=okat several out-of-state schools.Harris is the remaining recruit who is No. 1 on my wish list  for twoexcellent reasons. First  he is the top DT prospect in the country. Second he is the only top DT who is considering the Longhorns.But Oklahoma is making a big run at him  and he is listening. He also isbeing heavily recruited by Florida State and he plans to visit the Seminole=sthis weekend.Harris earlier listed Texas No. 1  but now says the Sooners and Seminoles a=rehis top two teams.He plans to visit Texas the Dec. 15 weekend  and has another trip set up toTexas A&M the Dec. 8 weekend.There actually is another top DT who is interested in Texas =01) Broussard ==01) buthe has many academic hurdles to clear.Jakes has already visited Texas  and the other nine players in that 10-mangrouping all say they plan to visit Texas the Dec. 15 weekend unless theirteams are still in the high school playoffs.Their teams will have to be really good to be still in the playoffs at thatpoint because that will be the weekend of the state semifinals in someclasses and the finals in other classes.There are some other great prospects who are  long shots  but are still inthe picture. They are headed by DT Marquise Hill  6-6  300  5.0  of NewOrleans De La Salle  and DE Justin Tomerlin  6-7  260  of San Clemente  Cal=.Tomerlin has been committed to Florida State for several weeks  but now say=she wants to visit several other schools  including Texas.

The Cotton Bowl brass likes the Longhorns and Texascoach Mack Brown loves New Year s Day bowls.If that doesn t come to pass  then it will be either the Holiday or Alamobowl for the Longhorns.What if Texas loses to Texas A&M?

Last season  12 of the 14 were on TV.But three games this season aren t being televised and two of them =01)Colorado and Kansas =01) are the longest road trips the Longhorns have in B=ig 12Conference play.The game in Colorado was nixed to allow Texas A&M at Baylor to be televised= and the Kansas game this Saturday won t be televised so the Iowa State atColorado game can be aired.I know the TV folks don t worry about fan inconvenience  but UT athleticofficials certainly should and one thing they should include in the deal ifthey decide to inconvenience their fans with 11 a.m. kickoffs in earlySeptember heat is assurance that the two longest road trips on the conferen=ceschedule won t be nixed for TV.One subscriber who couldn t attend the La-La game because of his doctor sorders told me Athletic Director Deloss Dodds should sit outside in the hea=twith the regular fans and he wouldn t ever have another 11 a.m. kickoff for= aSept. 9 game.I think most fans are willing to accept some inconvenience  but I think the=yexpect some sort of a trade off.In other words  if we need to have some early games for TV  then we shouldget preference on the TV for the faraway games  especially when they go upagainst the likes of A&M at Baylor and Iowa State at Colorado.It wouldn t have been a hard sell. But apparently no one in the UT AthleticDepartment thought enough of the fans to ask for a quid pro quo.Let s hope they do next year. After all  it takes pretty loyal fans to sellout big stadiums Saturday after Saturday when their team hasn t finished inthe top 10 in 17 long years.Horns Sign Fine Baseball ClassTexas baseball coach Augie Garrido has signed 12 of the top high schoolplayers in Texas and throughout the country."Through the hard work of recruiting coordinator Tommy Harmon  Frank Anders=onand the entire baseball staff  we have once again been able to sign atremendous recruiting class for next season " Garrido said."This group includes some of the top prospects in the state and will help u=smaintain this program s tradition of excellence " he added.The signees included right-handed pitchers Luis Cortez of Sinton  JoeyGuajardo of Round Rock and Donald Levinski of Weimar.Cortez  who ranks fifth in his class academically  posted a 0.82 ERA lastseason and averaged two strikeouts per inning en route to being named theDistrict 30-3A Junior of the Year.Guajardo went 11-2 on the mound for Round Rock High School during the 2000campaign and was chosen Central Texas Player of the Year after boasting a0.91 ERA  recording 172 strikeouts over 85 innings of work and pitching fou=rno-hitters.Levinski led Weimar to the Class AA State Championship last year and earnedAll-State accolades after registering a 14-1 record  an 0.70 ERA and 170strikeouts over 95 innings of work.Joining that trio is shortstop Michael Hollimon of Dallas Jesuit who batted.373 last year with seven triples and was rated the 10th best prospect atthis year s Area Code Games  plus two right-handed pitcherswho also double =asshortstops.
