john.enerson@enron.com,andrew.edison@enron.com|richard.lydecker@enron.com|richard.b.sanders@enron.com|dzolkin@milbank.com,"based on my conversation with ann-ellen hornidge last night ( counsel to bondholders ) , we need to reconsider our strategy regarding how to prevent the $ 4.5 million letter of credit from being drawn . there is currently a letter of credit issued in the amount of $ 3.0 million . this letter of credit is to increase by $ 4.5 million ( to a total of $ 7.5 million ) on the completion date . although our rights are set forth in the subordinated loan agreement , and the subordinated loan agreement contains a definition of completion date , the letter of credit uses completion date as defined in the indenture . the definition of completion date in the indenture and the subordinated loan agreement both contain references to the epc contract and the required tests . they both contain the same language of events that happen in the event that the epc contract is terminated . nevertheless , although the definitions of completion date in the indenture and subordinated loan agreement are identical , there is a subtle difference that could have a severe consequences . ( someone should investigate why this difference occurred ) . enron north america is not a party to the indenture . thus , for purposes of the indenture , the epc contract ( and the required tests ) can be amended and changed provided that all parties agreed ( this would be the trustee and can fibre lackawanna ) . this would be a default under our subordinated loan agreement , but we have no remedies . for purposes of certification under the letter of credit , all the trustee needs to receive is the documentation stating that the completion date has occured . obviously , this is not what we want . richard and andy - please provide your thoughts on how to prevent this from happening . my suggestion is that we immediately take control of can fibre via the section 38 proceeding . we revoke all authority ( and notify all parties of such ) to amend or execute any changes to the epc contract with board approval ( which would be us ) . we could show some accomadation about any new epc contract , but as to the key factors , we would stick to the language in the documents that say the test have to be as close to the originals . obviously , this has to be scrubbed from a legal perspective regarding how to can control and how to limit our exposure . we also need to anticipate any reactions ( for example , changing control is probably a default under the senior loan and they can enforce some remedy ) . the point is that if we do nothing , there is a good chance that we lose $ 4.5 million . we need to be very aggressive ."

( note : the budget process usually occurs in the august-october timeframe ) . on the financial side , we keep current as to the rates and the expertise available on the market , as well as , track potential conflicts of interest . it s our job to know our environment and to lay out strategy . on an annual basis , we adjust our resources which can include dropping some issues , reassigning personnel , hiring or letting go necessary outside counsel , etc . we remain mindful that in order to achieve legislative success , it is necessary to follow long-term planning so as to allow for us to build credibility , keep important political relationships viable and , ultimately , place us in the best possible political position to achieve success . our budget does its best to recognize that the congressional process can be unpredictable and that congress reacts to fast occurring events and public reaction . it is rare when we have not foreseen some form of a potential issue ; thus , we always operate within budget . an example of a contingency issue would be india setting off a nuclear device , a possibility we had accounted for yet could not possibly exactly predict nor could we predict the fall-out and precise corporate impact . however , we were still able to budget for possible permutations for such an occurrence and make adjustments as needed in order to meet our goals and stay within our budget . based upon the experience of the people in our office , we have been very successful in anticipating these type of occurrences . our report details our 1999 results and projects enron priorities for 2000 although neither the president s state of the union address which outlines the executive branch s legislative agenda for 2000 nor the republican congressional response and 2000 congressional legislative agenda has as of yet been delivered nor finalized ."

( we know this is the view of one of chairman tauzin s counsels , who formerly worked for southern co. ) . chairman tauzin has been contacted by entergy and the louisiana public service commission to send the letter . i spoke to chairman barton s staff , andy black , this afternoon and relayed our concerns . the barton subcommittee is now expected to mark up an electricity bill in december ( per a republican member meeting held this morning ) . action item : call rep. joe barton ( 202/225 - 2002 ) talking points : 1 . should start with something about the dynegy/enron transaction ( it will be strange if mr. lay or steve calls chairman barton and does not start the conversation with some reference to the transaction ) . 2 . mentioning the transaction naturally leads into the importance of competitive wholesale markets for power , both for consumers and for the largely texas-based marketing , trading and merchant power industries . 3 . we understand that chairman barton has been approached by chairman tauzin about a letter to ferc on the rto issue . we know chairman barton is well aware of enron s strong support for ferc s rto initiatives . we respect chairman barton s interest in seeing to it that congress does not abdicate its responsibility to make energy policy . 4 . if , as we have been lead to believe , the letter states or implies that ferc does not have authority to act in the rto arena , this will be seen as a potentially destabilizing development since ferc is so far down the road of creating rtos . 5 . while we understand some in congress and elsewhere were concerned that ferc was moving too fast , as of the last ferc meeting earlier this month , that is no longer true even if it ever was true . while we think rtos should be created sooner rather than later , ferc is listening to state regulators and others who had concerns . 6 . a letter from congressional leaders questioning ferc s authority goes too far in the direction of those who oppose any rtos . furthermore , it is wrong as a matter of law . the d. c. circuit held in the gas cases and in the power cases on order 888 that ferc has authority to address systemic discrimination , which is in large part what the rtos are all about -- a remedy for iscrimination ."
